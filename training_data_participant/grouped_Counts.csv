I would find this experience super enjoyable. I love learning different cultures and languages (I have a minor in Japanese). I would devote a lot of time studying up about Norway, and even ask my company to send me there if the opportunity arises.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. I feel like learning about another country and culture would be fun. I think knowing more about a country would widen my knowledge about things and would be better for me. I am always interested in learning new things and I just think this would be fun.,1,
I would find it enjoyable because I would be relieved that I didn't have to travel there. I can do a lot of research online and watch videos to get a sense of what it is like to be from Norway. I feel like I could spend a lot of time with that and it would make the Norway client appreciate that we are trying to understand their culture.,1,
I would love to have the opportunity to learn about and experience a different culture, with or without the travel.  I think it would be a wonderful experience.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable as I am curious about other countries and cultures. I would do the best job possible so I can get similar assignments in other countries. Maybe I could travel to some of the countries on business.,1,
I personally would find this experience enjoyable. I love traveling and going to new places, and if I got paid for it that would be a bonus in my opinion. Now if the travel expenses weren't paid for, or I didn't get paid I may not go. It depends on the situation,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. It would be challenging but it would not be boring. It is always fun to learn new things about other cultures.,1,
I would think this was a great opportunity.  Learning about Norway would be a great task.  The travel aspect wouldn't be that bad if needed.   I would volunteer.,1,
I will surely find this experience enjoyable.  I like challenges but I do not like to travel. This is perfect.,1,
I would find this enjoyable. The opportunity to learn about a different culture is exciting. With these skills, I should be able to impress our new client.,1,
I would probably find it boring. Norway doesn't sound that interesting, honestly, and I would probably have other work to do. I guess it wouldn't be bad, but I wouldn't be excited at all about it.,1,
I would enjoy it. I like to learn about other countries cultures. I would be eager to communicate with an overseas partner so I could learn more about them. I would also secretly hope I would have an excuse to visit them so I could travel. I think it would be enjoyable.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. I have never been to Norway nor do I know much information about it. Interacting with people abroad can prove to be an interesting experience. I may well learn something valuable from this.,1,
I would find it boring.  I would rather do something else.  Learning is no fun without travel.,1,
i would find it very enjoyable. i would be learning of a new culture, i would be learning of a new country. i may also be meeting people from a new country as well.,1,
I think it would interesting to learn a few things about Norway and its culture. And while I would not necessarily need to travel, perhaps there is the potential of visiting Norway at the company's expense. Plus, it's an opportunity that could lead to something better.,1,
I would find this experience really enjoyable! I love learning about other cultures and ways of life, and do so in my free time. So getting paid to work with it would be awesome, and probably a nice change of pace.,1,
I would probably enjoy it, although I am not positive. I do not know much about Norway but then again that might be one of the perks, that I have to learn more about it. It might look good in the eyes of my company to take on the added responsibility so that may weigh my decision as well.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. I like learning about other cultures. Also this opportunity seems like it could be an opportunity for travel, which I enjoy.,1,
as long as the project did not involve strange hours, I would volunteer. I would enjoy learning the language, up to a point, and interacting with the people from Norway as long as I did not have to adjust to their time zone. I would not want to travel, although I am sure norway is beautiful,1,
I would find this an enjoyable experience.  I have never been to Norway nor do I know a lot about the country or its customs.  It would be fun to learn more and a once in a lifetime opportunity to travel there all expenses paid.  I would look forward to this.,1,
I would enjoy this experience and would gladly learn all I can about Norway. I would even go so far as to learn some of the most common phrases and how to properly acknowledge people. I think it would be a great experience to learn about this different culture.,1,
I would absolutely find this enjoyable. I would volunteer to do so. I would also hope that some travel would be involved.,1,
I would find the experience relatively enjoyable and interesting. I like learning about new things, and Norway and that whole area of Europe is actually a place I'm curious about because I think in a lot of ways those countries are better than the U.S. (higher standard of living, less violence). I'd be very willing to volunteer for the project.,1,
I am an anthropologist. Learning about other cultures is part of what I do, It would be boring since I wouldn't be traveling to Norway. That would be disappointing.,1,
I would personally find it boring, because there's not really a payoff for me. If I was going to take the time to learn the culture, I would want to travel and experience Norway. I wouldn't want to invest the time in learning about the country, without really gaining anything in return. I would pass on this opportunity.,1,
I would probably find this experience enjoyable. I like to learn about other cultures. I would also take this as an opportunity to get to know my client better.,1,
I would definitely find it enjoyable, it is always fascinating to learn about new cultures, and see how others are different in a good way. it is also expanding my territories, who knows? i might need to travel to Norway in my next job.,1,
I would find this enjoyable since I would learn Norwegian culture in return.  Whether in person or not I would be open to learning a little of their language and teach them mine.      Volunteering at work that's fun!,1,
I would probably not be very into this project. I like more traditional and mechanical type tasks. I usually don't go too far outside of my box with cultures and trying to navigate foreign relations.,1,
I would love to do this project.  Learning about other cultures and getting involved with the culture is very interesting to me.  I am a history degree and I love learning all the aspects of a culture, art, history, food, economy and how they feel about the world.  It would not be work for me to get involved with this project.,1,
I would find that the experience would be enjoyable.  It would give me a chance to do research on a new culture.  This project would also give me a chance to maybe get end on some high end deals and give me more exposure in a positive light by showing initiative.,1,
I would find it enjoyable. I don't know if I would volunteer if I couldn't travel to the country. It makes the extra work more worth while.,1,
I would find it interesting. I know nothing about Norway. It would be good to learn about Norway and it's culture.,1,
I don"t really like to travel, so that aspect of not having to is fine with me. I like to read about different places and cultures. I enjoy watching programs about other countries on PBS. I get bored with America sometimes, so I like to learn how life is in other places. I think I would enjoy this project.,1,
I would find it enjoyable.  First, it is a great opportunity to learn something new and increase my stock with the organization; its always good to increase your value.  Second, it would be good to be involved in a project where I could get PAID to learn about aother places.,1,
I would enjoy it.  It would be interesting to learn about Norway.  I would like to do business internationally.,1,
I would find this very enjoyable, as I have little experience with much diversity living in small town USA. I would happily embrace the opportunity to learn about a new culture, and go all in on it. I would do anything necassary to get acclimated, and likely do much research online, and find someone from the area to bounce things off of (ie differences in our cultures). I think it would be beneficial for myself as well as others, and I would enjoy it greatly.,1,
I would find this opportunity to be a fantastic experience. I would jump at the chance to be involved in this project. The opportunity to work with a client in Norway would be so interesting.,1,
I would love this. In my 20's I moved overseas to Switzerland all alone. I knew no one, didn't know the language and didn't have a job set up in advance. I went on a whim and stayed 4 years. I love learning about new cultures.,1,
I would find the experience boring. I think it would be a little pointless. It just doesn't seem interesting in any way.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. I believe it's a great thing to learn about other countries and cultures. I also wouldn't mind traveling at all either.,1,
I would find this experience very exciting and fun. I love to learn about different countries and their culture. I would even volunteer if there was travel involved because I love to travel to other countries I've never been to before.,1,
I would find this experience quite enjoyable, I love learning new things. I would find fun and pleasure in taking on this extra work, especially if travel were to come into play. I always like to learn new things and expand on my knowledge of cultures in this world. It helps that I'm sure it would help me out in my career too, and progressing it.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable.  How often are you paid to learn about another country for your job?  Awesome!,1,
I would love it! I don't know much about Norway, although I read Kristin Lavransdatter, and haven't had the opportunity to work with Norwegians before. I'd be the first one to sign up for this.,1,
I would find this experience to be fun. I would love to learn about another country and their cultures. I think it would be fascinating to take on a project like this. It's a change of pace from the normal day to day grind, and would let me learn along the way.,1,
I would most likely dislike the feeling of 'forced worldliness', especially if it involves the difficult task of learning Norwegian. Other than that I think I'd enjoy, and even volunteer for the assignment.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable. I would get to learn about another culture and gain more knowledge to further my career. I really would jump on this project to get a leg up in the company.,1,
I would find this project interesting. I am very interested in other cultures and countries. I would look at this request as an opportunity to learn about Norway's culture and country, and would enjoy doing so. This could be a great learning opportunity and I would like to take full advantage of it.,1,
I would find this very enjoyable, and I would probably begin studying Norwegian on my own right away.  The opportunity to learn more could lead to new opportunities and maybe travel in the future.,1,
I would find this experience a bit boring. I have little to no interest in Norway and having to learn about a country and culture that does not interest me would be boring. If it were for a country that I cared more about, I would find it enjoyable and as a great motivation to learning more about the culture.,1,
I would enjoy learning more about Norway. I did a project on Norway as a first grader and have enjoyed the country and her people since then. Maybe I would get lucky and be able to travel there for work.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable because I love learning about other countries. It would be fun to do something different and to learn from other people and about other cultures. I would like to have the responsibility so I could show other workers and my boss that I am competent enough to fulfill the duties assigned to me.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. I also think it would be good knowledge to know in general. It would give me an advantage for new jobs.,1,
I would welcome the chance to delve deeper into another country's culture because it expands my own experience and knowledge. I would definitely be willing to travel if the need arose. It would be quite educational.,1,
I would find this very interesting, I would want to learn as much as I could about it before I went and make sure it really is a learning experiance.,1,
I would find it very enjoyable and I would love to do it. I love to travel and learn about other countries and their cultures. I would learn as much as I could and then later talk to the client about what I had learned. If this eventually resulted in a trip to Norway I would love it!,1,
I would find it very enjoyable and intriguing. I would definitely want to participate in this opportunity. I would welcome the chance to learn something new and have a different and unique experience.,1,
I would find it interesting, even more so if I would get a chance to travel.  I like learning about other cultures and ways of doing things.  I already often take the chance to learn about these things when I have the opportunity.  Definitely I'd find this project enjoyable.,1,
I'd hope it to be an enjoyable experience. Norway could be a nice place, so too the people. Hopefully, coworkers are tolerable and pace is relaxed.,1,
I would very much working with a client from Norway. I wouldn't mind traveling there either. I love to learn languages and culture. I think it would be really interesting to find out what the unique needs and interests are of the Norweigan people and how we could best be of service to them.,1,
I would probably find the experience a bit frustrating because the client doesn't know our customs.  I would do my best to accommodate them, though.  I would feel extremely awkward while doing so.,1,
I would find this experience very enjoyable as I have an extended family member from another Scandinavian country, and would enjoy learning as much as possible about the country and culture.  I would absolutely volunteer for this project.  I also like to limit my travel for business, so I think this would be a perfect fit for me.,1,
I would find it enjoyable because I like learning about other countries.  It might be fun to travel there and I like food so maybe I could learn about the food from Norway.  It might be a nice change from the regular work and it could be interesting.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable.  I like learning about other countries and cultures.  I do not mind travelling so even that would be fun for me.  Expanding one's horizons is never usually a bad thing.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable, because I love learning about other cultures. I would take this opportunity to gain knowledge, for my own interests. Gaining the extra knowledge could also help me gain more opportunities in the future, and could allow me to travel in the future, as well.,1,
I would find this to be enjoyable. I feel that if the company is currently dealing with Norway it is possible that there may be future dealings with others from Norway. It would be a good thing to have in my skills and on my resume to have knowledge of the country and self fulfilling to learn more.,1,
I would find it interesting.  I like learning about other cultures without actually experiencing them by travelling.,1,
I would find the experience to be rewarding because not many people have this chance to learn about cultures.  I would also would love to try their foods.  I would also like to maybe share what I have learned.,1,
One of my favorite parts of any job is learning new things.  I would love the experience to learn stuff about a new country.  I wouldn't mind traveling.,1,
I would enjoy being involved with this project.  I like learning new things about different countries and culture, especially those connected with western civilization.  If there was any chance of having to travel, I would not volunteer because I hate flying.  I have some interest in the music scene in Norway right now, though, so I would definitely like to learn more about the people there.,1,
I think this would be a great opportunity to learn about Scandinavian culture. I'm fine traveling to Norway. That trip is too long.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable. I think it's fun to learn about other cultures, and Norway seems pretty tame/normal, so I think I would probably enjoy dealing with the client. I would probably try to persuade the client and my company that I would need to travel to Norway at some point.,1,
I would find the experience interesting because it is different from the tasks I perform normally.  I  would like to inform myself about the cultures of other countries because I am curious and I believe that it opens the mind.  I would like know more about Norway because it fascinates me.,1,
The short answer is both. Some things would be boring and others would be enjoyable. I would likely not volunteer for this project because I know nothing about Norway at all. But if no one wanted to do it, I would do it, and in the process earn some respect (and future considerations) from the people that I work with.,1,
I would very much like this experience. It really does not get any better than to travel for work and get paid for doing it. its truly a win-win situation.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. I really like learning about different cultures, and even if I did not have to travel. It would still be fun to learn all I can to help the new client feel really apart of the family.,1,
Yes, I would definitely find this opportunity enlightening. I enjoy learning about different cultures that are different from my own. As an employee of a company that has culturally diverse clients, I feel that it would be important for me to expand my worldview as this would not only help me in my career but also in my personal life.,1,
I would find this experience extremely enjoyable. I love learning about new places and ways of doing certain things. I can not travel very much due to obligations but research and talking with someone, would be very interesting.,1,
I would love to learn more about culture! I have an anthropology degree, so learning about culture is what I do. It would be a valuable experience to grow as a person without having to travel internationally.,1,
I would find this enjoyable because it is always nice to learn about different cultures. It would be fun taking the time to research Norway  to see what type of place your clients grew up in and any type of traditions that their culture participates in. It would be nice incorporating their traditions into my project.,1,
I would find it enjoyable because I'm learning something new. I would be able to put myself in a better position for the company and the client. I would become an asset and it could help me in future endeavors.,1,
I would find this to be a very enjoyable situation. I like having the opportunity to learn about new things. Especially to be able to learn about new cultures and places that are different, but may be the same in some ways from where I live. While being able to travel there would be great, but the process of learning more about them on my own and the potential to converse with them, would be good as well.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable and exciting. I would love to take on a new experience and learn something new. I would enjoy the research and feel like a bigger person at the end of it.,1,
I think it would be enjoyable. I like to learn. And I like learning about other places and cultures. This would give me a chance to expand my experience with the world.,1,
I would enjoy this experience because I would like to fantasize about being in a decent, liveable country. It would be great if it could lead to me getting out of this country, maybe even permanently.  In any case, I like learning about other places.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable. I personally like to learn about different cultures and can actually appreciate other cultures as I do empathize with foreigners. It would also be a way to broaden my horizons which would be great for personal growth.,1,
I would find this boring.  It would be boring to learn about the culture but not be able to travel there.  The best way to learn the culture would be to travel. I would want to find a way to travel there.,1,
I would find the experience to be enjoyable. I have always liked learning about different cultures even if I am unable to immerse myself in it by traveling or visiting different countries. I feel that volunteering for the project will help to expand my horizons and improve my image with my supervisor. The project will also likely be a welcome change to my daily activities because it involves doing things differently and this helps to make the work more engaging.,1,
I would find this experience helpful and a bit interesting.  I think I would be motivated by work, but then enjoy some of the learning I would do.  I think I would be good at this task.,1,
I would find it enjoyable for sure. I like learning about new cultures. It is always interesting to see how different other people live around the world. You never know who you will meet.,1,
I would feel this experience as enjoyable and more interesting. I like to learn different cultures from different countries. It leads to know the traditional values of many countries,1,
I would enjoy a project like this one. I enjoy learning about other languages and cultures. I would be disappointed if there was no travel, but I would still participate,1,
This is not a binary choice. It doesn't have to be either enjoyable or boring. I don't think I would find this interesting which isn't the same as saying I would find it boring. Working with people far away means working with an obstacle. I don't want obstacles. I want my work to be smooth and easy.  So I would probably not volunteer and if the situation changed and traveling was required I would definitely not volunteer.,1,
I would love to learn more abot the cuklture of Norway, I like learning about opther culters so this is a great way to do it. I would also have a "big in" with the management as a voumteeer and do something that the company would reward me later for monetairly anyway,1,
I would find this project to be enjoyable.  It never hurts to broaden my horizon.  If I learn about the clients country and culture it would show the client my company cares.  It would also give myself and my company some knowledge on how things are done in the clients culture.  This could potentially strengthen of relationship with our client.,1,
I think it would be enjoyable to learn about a new country and culture.  It would be a great opportunity to go outside my bubble and learn something new.  It would allow me to be a bit more learned and gain new experiences in life.  It would be a great adventure.,1,
I would find this experience very enjoyable and engaging. I love learning about other cultures and I haven't learned anything about Norway yet. This would be an opportunity to learn about the Norwegian culture and interact with Norwegian people. I could also gain a little more perspective, too.,1,
I would probably volunteer to show initiative. I would enjoy doing research and finding out about the culture. It would be different from usual work.,1,
I would absolutely find this to be an enjoyable experience. Having never been to Norway, I would learn so much on top of being able to see it, even if I don't do anything but work on the project. Furthermore, I would have the opportunity to build international work relationships. This sounds like a great opportunity for everyone, involving work, growth, and adventure.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable and interesting. I always like learning about other places and cultures, and this would give me an opportunity to do so. I also think it would be interesting to work with a client from a different country, and possibly with some of their employees or representatives. I think it would be a great opportunity to possibility to make some new professional contacts and learn some things that may help me in my career.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable, because I would get to learn about another country and culture. I also would volunteer, because this is interesting to me. I also like learning about other cultures.,1,
I would actually find it enjoyable because I'm a people person and I love to talk. I also love sharing my culture- the good and bad with anyone willing to listen. The same is true for my country - any time I can brag about my country, I will so this client would be a good match for me.,1,
I would think that not traveling to Norway and just researching it would be boring. I would rather travel there and get to know it personally, meet the people there and learn the history from others' words rather than a book or the internet. I would still research on the internet but as a social person, I learn more from trying new things and talking to others.,1,
I would definitely love this opportunity. I love learning about new cultures and experiences. I also think this would be impressive on my resume for future projects. I would gladly accept the challenge.,1,
I would love to do this. I like finding out new things and talking with people from other countries. I would enjoy the experience and probably want to travel there. Its very nice to meet new people from around the world.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable. I would prefer if there were some trips to Norway, but regardless of needing to travel to Norway, I would still enjoy getting to know the Norwegian client and learning more about their culture. Norway has a long history and there is a lot to learn about their country and culture and there would be a good opportunity to learn about them from a Norwegian, or at least get their perspective about what I learned from other sources.,1,
I would find this experience really positive. I really enjoy meeting people from different cultures and learning about different cultures. I think it would be fun to make some conections with people from a different country.,1,
I would find this experience boring. I don't find much pleasure in research projects like this. I would rather let someone else who is more excited about the project do it rather than me.,1,
I would be happy to be part of the project because I'm interested in that country, so I would accept. I would be eager to learn and be happy to travel if the opportunity arises.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable. I'm always interested in learning about new cultures and new people. Also, maybe it would lead to travel to Norway in the future.,1,
I would be so excited and secretly screaming inside with Joy, It would feed the adventurous and spontaneous inner part of me. I would totally take advantage of this opportunity and offer myself for travel out of the Country, I am Passport ready :)  if needed to fully submerge myself.,1,
I would find this experience extremely enjoyable. It would be a dream project to be able to get paid to learn about another country and culture. I love learning about other cultures. Although travel isn't necessary, if the opportunity arose to travel for the project I would definitely jump on that as well.,1,
I would find this experience boring, because it sounds like homework to me I'm not interested in. Also, I would not appreciate having to do this unless it had something worth my while to do it. Because of this I probably wouldn't do it and plus, I don't care for learning a ton about country and culture in other countries except for Japan and Ireland.,1,
I think it would be a new experience and I would enjoy learning more about a new culture,1,
I would find it to be enjoyable and see the chance for growth, both professionally and personally. It would give me the opportunity to expand my resumé and work experience within the company. I find learning about different cultures and new languages to be intriguing.,1,
I would love it actually. I love learning about other places but would not be able to travel right now because of my kids. This sounds like it would be a very rewarding experience.,1,
I would find this enjoyable. To learn about another culture would be fun and different. If I were to do this, I would insist on traveling there to put all I’ve learned to use.,1,
I would find this experience stimulating. I like to learn about other cultures and their customs. I would probably volunteer for this assignment for the learning experience alone. Also, I would look like a hero.,1,
I would find this experience exciting, because I love learning about new places and cultures. I would spend a lot of time researching Norway and the people of Norway. I would also try to find out if anyone I know has information about Norway.,1,
I might find it boring if am not travelling. Because what's the point of learning anything if travel is not included that's the most exciting part for any project.,1,
I generally enjoy learning about places and cultures.  If there is future benefit to my involvement, I would be more enthusiastic.  Volunteering in a corporate setting needs to be compensated.,1,
I would love to be part of the experience.  I truly enjoy learning about different cultures and countries and would embrace the opportunity on a personal level.  On a professional level, it would look great on my resume!,1,
I would definitely find this enjoyable. I'm the type of person who actively tries to learn new things. I read quite a lot so I would find it rewarding to learn things about Norway's culture and fun facts about the country. You never know when this could benefit you in the future so I don't think it would be boring or detrimental in any way. Also, if I were to volunteer for the project then my boss would be able to see my hard work and would hopefully find me to be an asset.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable because it is always fun learning about other countries and their cultures, this is also being done for something related to the work I would be in and it is good to show you care enough to be willing to learn about a new culture and country for the sake of your business.,1,
I would find it great.  I am scandinavian blood so this is easy.  I would love to travel there if possible.,1,
I would love it! I don't know much about Norway, and what a great opportunity to learn. I'm fascinated by people from different countries and cultures and I leap at every chance I get to learn about something other than what I'm familiar with.,1,
I would love this experience. The idea that it may include travel is great. Also learning new cultures is something I love to do.,1,
I would find this experience very enjoyable. I would be interested in learning about Norway and the differences between the US and Norway. This will help build and foster a stronger relationship with the client from Norway.,1,
I would enjoy having this opportunity. I love learning about new cultures and finding new experiences. For me, this would not be boring but instead would be very exciting.,1,
I would think it sounds exciting and enjoyable. The fact that you don't have to travel , but implied you could, seems interesting. I would volunteer also because it seems like something that would help long term with my position at the company,1,
I would probably find the experience enjoyable because I like to learn about different cultures.  This is quite easy now with the internet.  Plus it also makes the job a little bit different so it wouldn't be the same old stuff.,1,
I would find this very enjoyable. I love to learn about new places. I think I have some ancestors that come from this region. It would be very enjoyable to learn about this culture, and serve this client.,1,
I would find this experience particularly enjoyable because I find learning about other cultures fascinating. This kind of learning leads to discovering new foods and new cultural items like books and films which I might find very enjoyable. Personal preferences aside, an opportunity like this would make me more valuable in the workplace since I would carry specific, prized knowledge that could be used for other clients in the future.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable. I like to learn new things and this would be the perfect opportunity to learn about a new culture. Learning is fun and educational.,1,
I would find this experience as an profesional opportunity to improving myslef. For sure I would acept this oportunity,1,
Absolutely enjoyable. I'd happy volunteer to go to Norway if it were needed. That would be a grand adventure.,1,
I would not find this experience enjoyable. I would be concerned about cultural barriers and accidentally offending the client. This project would require a lot of research on Norway, which would be time consuming.,1,
I think that it would depend on the person. If the person isn't the kind of person that likes to respond to others and have a conversation it would be very boring. I would also prefer to to take them to the actual location so that they can appreciate the information and culture more.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable.  It is not everyday you get to go to Norway.,1,
I think this would be very interesting! I would also hope I got the opportunity to travel to Norway! Always a good idea to know personal things about clients!,1,
I think this would be a very exciting experience. It would give me an opportunity to help someone learn about this country and I'm sure I would learn some things about theirs as well. I would be eager to help and learn new things.,1,
I would absolutely love this opportunity. I love to learn about new languages and cultures. I also feel that it is very important when doing business with companies overseas to see things from their perspective and to show that it matters to you.,1,
I would find this project very enjoyable. I like to learn about other cultures and new ways to do things. I also think it would be valuable to my company if I learned more about our foreign clients country and culture because it could help us customize our projects for our client and make our client feel respected.,1,
I would love the chance to be involved with the project.  I love learning new things and I would also prove myself with my company.  I’m sure I would do the job well!,1,
I would find the job very interesting because I enjoy learning about new cultures as well as doing research. I would find volunteering for this job enjoyable.,1,
I would find it boring. If I could travel there it would be fun. But just to learn things about the country and not experience would not be the same.,1,
I would find this enjoyable. It would be different than my usual daily activities. Also, I would be getting paid to learn about something interesting. I also like the idea of not having to travel, which would be a bad thing, since I do not like flying.,1,
I would enjoy the experience. I would ask to travel to find out as much as I could. I would also see the travel as a mini- vacation,1,
I love the idea of learning about Norway. I WOULD be a bit nervous about dealing with a foreign client though, so I'd make sure to intensively learn about Norway. I think it would be an enlightening experience.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. I think it would be fun to learn about another country, especially in the context of work. Having the learning take place in a work context would reinforce my learning. I would likely be able to take that learning and apply it in my real life. For instance, maybe I could take a personal trip to Norway if I find what I learn to be interesting.,1,
I would find this enjoyable. It's fun in general to learn about new cultures. But I especially think Norway has a unique history. I currently don't know a lot about Norway, but I think it would be fun to learn about it as part of a project.,1,
I would be willing to learn some things about the country. It maybe doesn't interest me but knowing that my client is from there I feel like I would be more interested in learning a few things.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable.  I have been to other countries and I would like learning about Norway.  I  find it stimulating to learn about new places.,1,
If I didn't get to travel there I might be upset.  I would still like to learn about the culture, food, people, history, etc. because I enjoy that.  It might lead to an opportunity down the road.,1,
Enjoyable. I always like learning new things and I think it would look great on a resume. Travel or not, it would be fine with me. Plus you never know what good opportunities will await you until you try something new.,1,

I would find this experience to be very enjoyable. I love learning new things. And I'm always interested in foreign cultures.,1,
I would find the situation enjoyable, although it would be more preferable if potential travel to Norway was involved.  I've always enjoyed learning about other cultures, and this project could provide excellent opportunities to learn more about Scandanavian culture.  Should the project and networking opportunity prove enjoyable enough, perhaps I'd consider traveling there on vacation at some future time.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable.  I mean it would be great to get to travel to Norway but just learning the language and culture of any different country is exciting.  It beats a normal everyday project in my book.  I feel like it would be a pleasent task to take on.,1,

I wouldn't mind learning about Norway. As long as I'm getting paid and get to do the research at work I'd be happy to spend some time learning about Norway. If they asked me to do it at home without pay I wouldn't do it.,1,
I would enjoy working on a project that requires me to learn new things and interact with people from places unlike those with which I am familiar.  It's always fascinating to find out about other cultures.  If travel were involved, that would be even better.,1,
I would find that very enjoyable. I enjoy different cultures and have always wanted to travel to Norway. All the Norwegian people I have met have been very polite so I am sure I will enjoy working with them.,1,
I would find it enjoyable because I'd get to find out more about Norway. As a person who loves learning about new cultures, it would be very rewarding for me. It's not necessary to travel, but I would want to just so I could learn as much as possible.,1,
Yes, I would love an opportunity like that.  I love to travel.  I love to learn about new cultures and places.,1,
I've been to Norway in the military, and I like the people, so I would probably find it enjoyable.  I'm glad it doesn't involve traveling, especially if it's winter. I would pretty quickly volunteer for the project.,1,

I would find this experience enjoyable because it will help me to learn a lot of new things.,1,

I would enjoy learning about Norway.  Any growth in intellect is a plus for me.  I enjoy travel and could even use some of what I learn for a future personal trip.,1,
I think it would very interesting to learn something new .I feel that the work would be really interesting and could help me in the future on other projects , that would make me look like a very good employee .It would be interesting learning about a different culture than mine to see how they do things,1,
So very enjoyable! I would ask to go to Norway and would pay some of my own expenses. I would learn basic Norse. It would be a great deal of fun for me. I travel whenever I can for enjoyment.,1,
I would think that it would be enjoyable. It would help us relate better to the client. It would also help improve my personal knowledge about Norway. In the future it would put me in a better position to be picked if they were to send someone to Norway.,1,
I would love to be involved in the project. I would find it to be enjoyable and a new experience for me especially if I can go to Norway. I love to see other countries and explore their culture. I think I will gain a lot of experiences and network from this project.,1,
I would find this experience extremely enjoyable due to the fact i am a traveler. I live and love to travel, i love new experiences, meeting new people, i love adapting to change and what it can bring. Any chance to go to another country is a chance to grow.,1,
I would find it to be a very enjoyable experience. I love traveling and learning about other countries and cultures all over the world. Any way to expand my cultural knowledge is great, especially if it is for my business and would perhaps allow me to move up in the company after some time. I think that this would show the client genuine interest, help prevent miscommunications and form a close bond that will help the client and myself feel more comfortable. The client would also most likely know about the US and our culture so I think it is only fair we meet half way and show interest.,1,
I would actually find this enjoyable. I love to learn about other places besides the United States. It will also serve me well when talking to the client. I will have a better understanding of how he/she wants things down and how I should talk to them.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. I have recently felt a renewed sense of curiosity.  Perhaps having a toddler at home who is always asking questions has awakened in me a new thirst for knowledge.  I would love to learn more about a wide variety of things.  I would like to take up new hobbies. I would love to read more, both fiction and non-fiction books. I would enjoy learning more about other countries, cultures, and ways of life. I think this would be a refreshing and enlightening project. I would go into it with an open, inquisitive outlook and I think that positive attitude would lead to a very enjoyable experience.,1,
I'd absolutely love this. I've been to Norway, have two good friends there, and my father had ties there, so the love of this place is big in my family. I'd also welcome the opportunity to learn about another country and culture, whether or not I get to travel. I'd find this very enjoyable.,1,

I would find this experience to be enjoyable because I would be paid to learn something.  Plus, learning about the country does not mean that I would not be asked to travel there sometime in the future.  It could also give me the opportunity to get leadership experience because I would help educate my coworkers on what I learn as the project continues.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable. I value opportunities to expand my horizons and discover more about foreign cultures and countries. I absolutely would be interested on taking on this particular task.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable because I am interested in new cultures.  I would probably try to learn a little Norwegian and study some history and watch some programs about Norway.  If it were a long running project I might even book a trip to Norway as a vacation.,1,
I would find this experience very exciting.  Not needing to travel to the country itself, but still needing to learn about the country and culture sounds refreshing to me.  It is a way to enrich not only my personal values but, my professional value within my company.  I would jump at the chance to volunteer to be involved in this project.,1,
I would definitely volunteer because I like learning about other cultures and different' parts of the world. I think it would very enjoyable and would help me in the long run with other clients as well. I could learn to help them based off of there needs.,1,
I would find this enjoyable. I like learning about different cultures. I would be up to this challenge. It would likely help my career as well.,1,
I would find it very enjoyable for sure. I don't know anything really about Norway or their history and culture and I like learning new things. I would like to travel, honestly, but honestly would find it fascinating just to learn about a culture that is different than mine and work with someone from another country.,1,
I would find this very enjoyable, provided I don't have to travel. It is a chance to learn something new, meet people from a very different culture, and put something very unique on my resume. I also find Norway interesting, and would like to learn more about it. I have commitments here, however, so I would only welcome this involvement if travel was not required, or if travel was required, no more than once a year, and for no more than 1 week.,1,
I would love a project like this. Norway is a wonderful place and I would enjoy learning about their culture. It would be a great learning experience that could lead to travel in the future.,1,
The situation would not be enjoyable or boring. I would be okay with it. However, I wouldn't love the situation, since I prefer to focus on my usual work, which I know how to do.,1,
I would find this opportunity exciting and would love to participate. The opportunity to interact and learn from somebody from another country would be very rewarding. It would also give me greater insight on our clients as well.  While it is volunteered effort I believe it would help me in my career as well.,1,
I would certainly find it enjoyable! I'm always open to learning new things and this is something I likely wouldn't go out of my way to do if not for work. I'm a quick learner and I believe I do thorough research, so this would be somewhat fun. I also believe this would better my future.,1,
I would find that really interesting. I think that it's always fun to learn about new countries and cultures, and this way I would also be able to connect with other clients from the same country. If anything, I would also love to travel to Norway one day.,1,

I think this would very enjoyable.  It would be interesting to learn about a new culture and its people to better understand my client.  It may even inspire me to want to visit that country someday.,1,
I would find it boring if I didn't travel. It'd be like watching a national geographic documentary on stuff you don't care about. If I did get to travel Norway however, I'd find it enjoyable because it would be an experience.,1,
I would most likely volunteer for the project.  I enjoy meeting people and  new learning about new cultures.  I would however feel slighted a bit about the Norway experience because the benefit of actually traveling there would be extremely educational.,1,

I would find the experience enjoyable. It never hurts to learn something new. I could always go to Norway in the future.,1,

I would find this experience enjoyable because I love about learning about new cultures from different countries so this would be a great experience to me and if I need to travel I will do it,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. I would be nervous about the amount of information I had to learn and in what time period. I would find this personally enjoyable because I have always been curious about other counties and cultures.,1,
I would would find the project interesting. Though I may find it boring due to the negative aspect of unable to travel and actually use skills I'm learning. Though it would as give me a challenge to see if I could complete. I think it would also have to deal on what was needed to be learn on cultural level.,1,
I would love this experience. I thrive on learning, especially when it comes to other countries and cultures. I would enjoy delving into Norwegian culture in order to improve my career standing.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. it is fascinating to learn about new places and would be cool to be able to lend a hand in future business endeavors with clients from other countries. I would hold that the opportunity might eventually lead to traveling to other countries.,1,
I would pass on the project. Something like that would take a lot of my personal time. I just don't have enough to spare.,1,
I would find this experience very enjoyable. I would have the opportunity to be apart of a new project and also learn new things about Norway. With me being apart of this project who knows this could turn into something more meaningful for me.,1,

I would find it enjoyable. It would be interesting to learn about the culture. It could also open the door for future opportunities with this client and I'd be the go-to person.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable, even if the thought of actually traveling to Norway is not very attractive to me.  I do enjoy learning about other cultures, and coincidentally, I am already quite interested in Scandinavia.  I would volunteer for this project, and then find a travel documentary about Norway, and read some general history of the country online.  From there, any more focused research would just be a slightly interesting, though otherwise routine, part of my regular duties.,1,
I would find it interesting and enjoyable why? I would give me something different to do,1,
I would absolutely jump at the opportunity to do this. I love to learn a lot and in depth about different things. Learning about another country would be great and help expand my own understanding of my country.,1,
I would like it. It would be cool. I'm half Norwegian. I could teach them about the US and they could teach me about my roots.,1,
I would definitely find it enjoyable. I love learning about new cultures, and find different people very interesting. Although I would enjoy traveling there even more, I would look forward to learning and growing my perspectives of the world.,1,
I would take this opportunity. I've never been to Norway, and it seems to be interesting to be able to visit a country that I've never visit before. Volunteering also give me a good opportunity to learn new things.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable because I like learning about new cultures. One of my favorite things to do is travel. If the project could also include travel I would be very interested. Either way it would be fun interacting with people from a different culture.,1,
I would find this experience very exciting and enjoyable. I like to learn about new places and their culture.

this would be interesting to me. I would like to learn more about other cultures. sometimes the only way to learn is by being forced to learn. I will take that oppurtinity to learn more about the culture,1,
I would find this experience very enjoyable because it would expose me to different cultures and things that I am not accustomed to and I am sure that I would learn alot in the process. It would also give me more experience and possibly open doors in the company because I am showing that I am willing to do what it takes to invest in the company and take on projects or responsibilities that others may not want to. It would be fun to learn about Norway to expand my knowledge without having to actually go there and I will be the only person who will have that knowledge and experience with the country.,1,
Yes I would.  I think it would be very enjoyable.  I don't often get to interact with foreigners.  It would be quite the experience.,1,
Absolutely.  I think this would be a great opportunity to learn a new culture and strengthen our relationship with Norway.  It would also show initiative with my leadership that I am willing to accept greater responsibility.,1,
I'd enjoy it.  I'd like learning about Norway, and it would give me something non-routine to do.  I like doing things that are not routine.,1,
I would be willing and definitely accept to be a part of this project . Because learning and exploring new things will be interesting and enjoyable.,1,
As a person that has been to Norway, I would be excited about the opportunity. Would definitely step up and take on a leadership role in acclimating other volunteers into Norwegian customs and culture. Learning and appreciating other cultures is always fascinating to me. I would look forward to the possibility of even traveling there is the assignment ever changed.,1,
I would find the experience boring since the task is to ask me to learn about things or Norway and its culture. Obviously without the ability to travel there, I will have to learn about the country base on books and other information. I don't find it will be enjoyable by learning a culture without the chance to experience it in person. This will definitely hinder my ability to fully learn and experience the truth first hand in person, thus I find it's rather bland and boring.,1,
I would find this experience extremely enjoyable. I enjoy connecting with people and learning new things. I am also part Norwegian so I  could learn something about my ancestors culture as well. I would probably knock people over jumping to my feet with my hand in the air saying "Me, me, pick me.".,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. I like to learn about other countries. maybe I could travel there in the future.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. It would be something different from my current job duties. If I do a good job maybe I would be compensated for my time and effort,1,
I would find the experience somewhat enjoyable. I find other cultures fascinating and interesting and enjoy learning new information, especially about history. I would also inform the company I would be greatly interested in travelling to Norway to help the client.,1,
I would volunteer for such a project as there would be a lot of interaction with the Norway client, but I would not have to travel out of the country. I would imagine a lot of interaction through conferencing software so that would be interesting. I also like the idea of learning about a country and culture as part of a work project.,1,
I would enjoy doing this task.  It is always interesting to learn something new.  It might even lead to travel to Norway either for business or on a personal level.,1,
I would find this project very enjoyable. I think it would be a great opportunity to learn something new. If I did get to travel to Norway it would just be a bonus, and if not I may decide to go on my own anyway.,1,

I would find this experience enjoyable as I think it is interesting in learning and understanding the customs of another culture. I would want to travel and be fully immersed in the culture for the purposes of the project.,1,
I would find this very exciting.  I would want to travel if possible.  Learning about new cultures always interests me and I would love to be involved in a project like this.,1,
It would be enjoyable to to be a part of this deal and learning new things about the country and their culture.,1,
I would definitely find it interesting! I am a firm believer of the saying of "learn as you would live forever" and I think knowledge is power. This information about the culture and country of Norway could easily benefit me later in life and being willing to learn would also make me look good in the eyes of the employer.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. The reason is that I particularly enjoy learning new cultures and traveling. It is essential to branch your business out to new clients and niches.,1,
I would find this experience extremely enjoyable. I have not had the opportunity to travel much in my life so I would be excited for it. I would feel bad about leaving my children and wife for an extended period of time though.,1,
On the face of it I would enjoy it. I maintain a mild to moderate interest in Nordic culture. I would gladly travel if called to do so. My interest is based on the history of the Nordic Countries' contributions to Christendom, their pre-Christian pagan mythology, their maritime and nautical aspects, and their weathers. Of note is also their sad reversion to paganism and the social and political costs of this reversion.,1,
I would find this experience boring if it were without travel. I believe you have to immerse yourself within the culture to truly understand it. Many things can't be learned just through online research.,1,
I would find it boring.  If travel was involved i would be inclined to do it.  Otherwise it seems like a waste of time.,1,
I would find this experience to be enjoyable, but sad it didn't include the travel.  I really enjoy learning about other countries, enjoy travel.  I would look forward to meeting some of the clients. I would definately volunteer for something like this, although I worked in health care, so didn't have this kind of opportunity in my real life.,1,
I would probably find the experience boring if I did not get to travel to Norway. If I did get to travel to Norway, then I would be enthusiastic about learning about the country and culture. The travel aspect will definitely feel like a bonus.,1,
I would definitely find the Norway experience enjoyable. Even though it doesn't necessarily mean that I would have to travel, it wouldn't hurt to learn some new things. It would convey that I am a team player.,1,
I would find the experience very rewarding and interesting.  I've always been interested in other countries and culture and would jump at the opportunity to learn about Norway.  I would definitely volunteer for the project and do as much research as possible.  Who knows, I might even visit Norway on my own dime after researching it.,1,
I would definitely enjoy learning about another country, culture and language. I think it would provide an opportunity to learn a unique skill, talent and knowledge about something and someplace that not many here in the United States know about.  This would be an enjoyable experience for me.,1,
This would really be fun for me. I love to learn about the history and culture of other countries and people. It helps me to understand them better. I would do some preliminary research and then volunteer for this position.,1,
I would find it enjoyable!  A great opportunity especially if travel for work would be a new experience.  It could be a chance of a lifetime.,1,
I would probably volunteer to be involved on the project. I enjoy learning new things and doing so in a work context would be nice. I would find the experience enjoyable because it would broaden my horizons, and might lead to something positive and unexpected. It would also be nice to not have to worry about travel.,1,
I would find this boring because I wouldn't get to go to the country. I would find it more beneficial for the project to travel to Norway. This would provide a first hand experience of the country.,1,
I would find this situation enjoyable because I like learning about new cultures. I would think about volunteering for it if there was definite travel and extra pay involved.,1,
I would love it! It would be even better if their was travel involved. If it was just learning about a new culture though that would be interesting too. It would be nice to mix it up at work and learn new things.,1,
I would find this experience neither boring nor enjoyable. It's part of my job, and if it has to be done, the it will be done. Norway or whatever, I would learn things that need to be learned and got the job done.,1,
I would find it enjoyable. Learning about other countries and cultures is like traveling. And if you ever do travel there you may have already gained valuable insight into that culture.,1,
I would definitely volunteer for this opportunity. I enjoy learning about other cultures. I feel that my enthusiasm for the project would benefit me personally, as well as benefit the company I work for.  Added benefits would be doing a job well, and advancing in the company.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable.  I like to learn new things and learn about other cultures.  It seems like an interesting opportunity.,1,
If there won't be travel involved, then I don't see a lot of opportunity to use my knowledge or apply it. If I am being asked to apply my knowledge in design, or if I WILL be travelling, then I would go above and beyond to  learn. I always love learning about new cultures and languages but I would need that extra incentive. Also, how many projects am I already working on? I wouldn't want to take on more work for no travel and spread myself thin.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable. It would give me the opportunity to learn new things and get paid for it. I might even find that I enjoy the culture. It’s always better to say yes to opportunity!,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable because I like to learn about new places. I am drawn to things out of my ordinary experience. I think I could learn things that I could talk about later in social settings.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable because I would be able to learn about a country that I might not be able to learn about in a normal scenario. Although travel isn't necessarily a need, it might be in the future, and I would like to be considered for that possibility should it arise. I would also enjoy working with a foreign client and getting to know someone else's culture outside of my own.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable. I love taking the time to find out about our customers needs and wants. The expectation of the customer is always paramount in my opinion.  I would find this enjoyable because I love learning about new places and cultures so that I can expand my knowledge of the world.,1,
I think it would be somewhat enjoyable to learn about another culture. It would be enjoyable to compare differences and similarities.,1,
I probably would find the experience somewhat enjoyable.  I always like to learn new things, and I probably wuldn't have learned whatever I would learn here otherwise.  Of course, if I found things about their culture disturbing, then I might not like it so much, but how else would I find that out?,1,
I think I would find it enjoyable. I'd actually be excited to go as I like traveling and exploring new places. The fact that I need to learn some things isn't a deterrent at all,but a welcome experience. I don't see why I would back out other than fear related reasons.,1,
I would find this extremely enjoyable. I've always had an interest in Scandinavian countries and would love to learn more about Norway. I would also like to learn a few phrases in Norwegian. I think it would be fun to speak with the new client in their language. It would be really fun to learn a new culture.,1,
I would find it interesting to volunteer to be involved in the project.  I don’t like to travel but it would be fun to learn a little bit about Norway, from the comfort of my own office.  I think it would be a unique experience and I always like to learn new things.,1,
It would be interesting because I think finding out things about people and different cultures would be fascinating,1,
I would find this enjoyable for a country I had some interest in personally.  I have always thought it would be fun to visit Norway so I would take to this task.  If the spot was not one I was interested in...then it would be more of a chore.,1,
I would be up for the challenge. I am always up for learning something new. Norway would not be my first choice, but it sounds like it would be somewhat interesting.,1,
I would find this experience very enjoyable. I've always wanted to learn as much as possible about other countries and cultures. I'm actually mostly Norwegian and even have family still in Norway so this would be an excellent experience for me.,1,
I think I would find it boring. I am not really interested in other countries or cultures. I would rather see it go to someone that would really enjoy taking part.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable. I have always found northern Europe to be an interesting place with a rich history and would enjoy having the chance to interact with people from that area. Its always interesting learning the unique things about a different culture.,1,
I would find the experience somewhat boring. It would feel like a book report of some kind or some school project. It would not be interesting unless there was an option to travel there to act as a bonus.,1,
I would find the experience somewhat boring as I am not particularly interested in learning more about Norway personally. I would also be frustrated that I don't get the perk or benefit of being able to travel and visit the country up. It is likely that I would resent the experience thinking about the missed opportunity, but it might be possible that I find some fulfillment from the experience despite being stationary.,1,
I would find it boring because I would not be able to travel. Just learning about Norway would not benefit me in anyway. I would only accept the position if i were able to travel.,1,
I would think this experience would be awesome! I love to learn about different cultures, and Norway seems like a cool place. I would definitely volunteer.,1,
I would enjoy doing this task and learning about a new country's culture. I think it's important to have an open-mind about different cultures for personal growth. Different cultures can teach people a new perspective on life, or a way to see things differently than previously thought of. I would enjoy this task and seeing what similarities or differences there are.,1,
I would find it enjoyable but would push hard to go there to see things firsthand.,1,
I would find it enjoyable, learning new  info about a different country would be educational.Someday you might get the chance to visit and know a lot about norway.,1,

I would find this enjoyable. I am Swedish and Finnish myself so I would hopefully find out some more about my heritage. If not at least the heritage of a nearby country.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. I would enjoy learning more about Norway & its culture.,1,
I would love to volunteer on this opportunity. Although it takes time on my job I love to discover new things and on our clients. This chance could be a good experience for me to deal with future clients.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable. Although learning a new language might prove difficult at first, I think immersing myself in a new culture will be beneficial in the long run. It's always interesting to see how people from other countries conduct business.,1,

I would absolutely like to experience this.  I would enjoy it a great deal as I love to learn about new cultures.  I think first I would read the Norway Wikipedia page to familiarize myself with the basics.  Then I might delve into a Norway subreddit to see what the people are really like, and what they talk about etc.  I would spend an hour or two (or more depending on how engrossed I get) in learning the culture so I can better interact with the client.,1,
I would absolutely enjoy doing this. I love to learn about new cultures and how they do business. I think it would be a fantastic open door with the company and client.

oh this would be fun. i think it would be very enjoyable. i would love to do the research and find out abut this place. find out what they do for fun and for holidays. find out about there everyday life. this would be so fun.,1,
I would find this experience neither enjoyable or boring based on the information given.  Without knowing the scope of the project, I don't know whether the effort needed would outweigh the benefit.

I have no burning desire to learn things about Norway, it would be passive enjoyment at most.,1,

I would find this experience enjoyable.  It would be a learn more about another country and culture.  It would be a chance to grow personally and professionally.,1,
I would find this experience somewhat enjoyable. I would like to learn more about the country and culture of the client, but I would feel bummed that I could not travel and learn first-hand in the country. I would make the best of it and try to imagine myself in the country and possibly learn something exciting that may make me consider personal travel to that location.,1,
I would find the process of investigating a new culture and country fascinating!  It would be enjoyable to learn new things and share them with the client. I believe my new found knowledge would be valuable to my company.,1,

From time to time I've read or heard snippets about how this cooly compassionate culture handles things -- economically and lawfully-- with some quite out-of-the-box troubleshooting. After actually doing some in depth study of Norway, I imagine I'd have some stuff for good conversation.,1,

I would find the experience delightful. I would love to visit another country. I think it is exciting to learn about others and other languages.,1,
I would find it attractive anyway, even though it does not necessarily mean traveling, that possibility will always be there. Also, to know other cultures is something that I like and, if at the end the trip is given, better. Also will show interest in the closed deal,1,
I would find this experience incredibly enjoyable as it's always great to learn about new places and cultures.  Even if travel to Norway wasn't involved I would still want to be a part of this project but travel there would only increase my interest.  I would make sure to put my best foot forward in this effort with our new client.,1,
I would enjoy this experience as learning some aspects of Norway would be enjoyable and show that I was engaged.  The only bad part would be having to travel but it looks like that is not a requirement.,1,

I would find the experience enjoyable.  I would want to learn new things.  I would be excited about the opportunity.,1,
I would find it enjoyable, because finding out about other cultures has benefits that extend beyond the workplace.

If the project went well, I would request to work on further projects with this client, or other Norweigian firms.,1,
I would find this very enjoyable.  I wouldn't be crazy about traveling to Norway but have no problem learning about other cultures.  I think it would be fun and help make my job more interesting,,1,
I would find this very enjoyable. Scandinavian countries are fascinating social, economically, politically, and have a rich history. This area in the world seems to have the highest standard of living and would be enriching to understand it better. This is an opportunity to grow my perspective of the world and people.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. I like to learn about different cultures and countries. I would be willing to travel as well if it were necessary.,1,
I would volunteer. Probably only if there was time and I could pick up some of the language, however I would ask the company to pick up the cost of language courses.

I would find the project enjoyable.  It would be an opportunity to learn new things.  It would be a challenge to work with a different culture.,1,
I would find this experience very enjoyable. I enjoy learning about new things, and I'm especially interested in new cultures.

I would find it enjoyable, because I love finding stuff out about new cultures. Plus, just because it doesn't necessarily involve travel now doesn't mean it won't later. And if I'm already on the team that puts me into prime palcement for any travel needs that come up with this client.,1,
I would defiantly volunteer. I love learning. And I also love different cultures and ways of living. I would enjoy the experience and wouldn't mind traveling either.,1,

I would view the potential experience to be very enjoyable. I think it could be fun to talk to this person about their culture while sharing mine as well.,1,
I would be excited to learn about this person's background. Me learning about Norway would show how considerate and respectful to them. The client would be more apt to forming  long term business relationship by my interest in Norway.,1,
I would take it on. I love working with people from other places. I also love learning about other cultures.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable if someone else was guiding the process, such as giving a class or presentation or pointing out things to read, but aggravating and frustrating if it needed to be a more self-guided process because a vague goal like "learn about a culture" is something I always find aggravating and difficult to engage with and open-ended research on topics like "the culture of Norway" are tough because there's no way to determine what's too much and what's not enough, and it can be difficult to determine which sources to trust over others.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. I would volunteer to do this. I find learning new cultures to be extremely interesting.,1,
I would find this experience very enjoyable.  It would be a chance to help someone learn about my culture.  I would be excited to also learn from the other person.,1,
I would find this situation delightful. We do not need a degree to volunteer all it requires is a heart and willingness to serve when the company need`s you. Besides a new experience might be fun in the end.,1,
I would find the experience very enjoyable. I would be interested in learning about the country, and finding out from the client how it is to live there. I have always been interested in people from places other then the US, and I would really enjoy the opportunity to talk to the client after doing a little research on my own.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable, though it would be even better if I could visit. I like to learn new things about other countries. I also always like to take the initiative at work. Being involved would help me do that and hopefully impress my boss. And perhaps some day, I'll even be able to travel there myself.,1,
I would love to learn more about Norway. It's the kind of think I'm personally interested in. It would be good for my reputation with higher ups and make me look good. It would give me one up among other co-workers.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable.  I am proud of our country and our history, so teaching someone about it would be very rewarding, in my opinion.  I also like taking on new tasks and this would be something that I've never done.,1,
I would find the experience mostly enjoyable, albeit slightly frustrating at times when trying to help the client navigate through parts he or she might find confusing. But for the most part, I would enjoy working with someone from Norway, since it would be an educational experience. It would offer me a chance to learn about another culture and expand my network as we worked together. I don't think it would be boring in the least.,1,
I would not find it enjoyable.  Why would you volunteer for something at work.  You work to get paid not to have enjoyment.  Enjoyment is available in your free time.  It would be nice to learn about Norway but it should be done with no strings attached.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. I think this would be a change of pace from the normal routine work experience. I would be excited to learn about a different country and culture and also get to meet a new client.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable because it would challenge me to grow my knowledge base.

I would love to be able to learn new things about a culture that didn't involve me having to travel. I would be taking on a project that could be good for not only me company, but also for me so that is a huge win win for me.,1,
I can't image that learning about Norway would be fun in any sense. In fact, it would be boring--like being sent back to geography class. (Now, I would find travel to Norway to be a LOT of fun, but that is not on offer here.),1,
I would probably find the project with the Norwegian client to be enjoyable. One of my favorite past-times is researching about various cultures around the world via books, news articles, and documentaries. While I am well versed in Asian cultures, I have yet to focus on Nordic ones such as Norwegian and Finnish cultures, so I would probably find this to be intriguing. To be honest, I'd actually prefer it if I were to travel to Norway to work with the client, since then I can partake in the local cuisine and sightseeing in my free time.,1,
I would find the situation boring. It would be information that might be useless since I would have to travel to the location. I could be spending my time working on something more valuable.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable. I love learning about culture. How other countries have evolved over the years is fascinating. It would make me a more well rounded person, more open to the ideas and practices of others.,1,
I would think this experiance would be enjoyable. I love learning about different cultures. I would love to learn about different countries and how they differ from us.,1,
I'd find it enjoyable. It would be interesting to learn about a place that I've never been and develop relationships with clients on the other side of the pond.,1,
I would find the experience interesting and beneficial.  The more I know, the greater benefit it will be to keeping the new client happy.  A happy client is easier to work with.,1,

I would definitely find the experience enjoyable. I enjoy learning about different cultures and how things are done in other countries. You don't necessarily need to travel to learn about the culture of another country.,1,
I would love this experience. It would be really interesting and fun. I love learning, and I love doing anything at work that's different, so that I'm not bored to death. I like adventures and changes in routine. Ideally, I would like to travel to Norway as part of this volunteer project.,1,
I think I would find this experience enjoyable because it would let you interact with another country. It would be less enjoyable because I might not necessarily get to go there and travel to use it in person and see the country in person. I don't think there's anything to lose by learning the culture and about the country. If anything it might make you more valuable at work.,1,
I would absolutely volunteer for this project. I find other countries and cultures very interesting. I would find the experience enjoyable. I would actually hope for travel. Perhaps doing a good job on the project would enable that to become a possibility.,1,
I would enjoy learning about Norway and their culture. I think it's fascinating to learn history and customs from other countries - it really enriches your life. It helps you better understand people and where they come from, not everyone has the same upbringing.,1,
I would find it enjoyable because I love learning about different cultures. I could possibly learn to speak simple phrases in Norwegian, which could impress the clients. Learning about new countries and cultures helps to make me a well rounded person.,1,
I think that would be enjoyable.  Learning new things and getting new ideas would be fun.  I think the accents of the new client and the demographic information would be enriching.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable. I would like it because it gives me a chance to learn something new. It is always great to learn about a different culture.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable.  I am interested in other cultures and would like to know more about Norwegian culture, their norms, the country, and how the people are.  I think it would make the project more interesting, while also broadening my knowledge about other cultures.  It would be disappointing to not get to travel despite getting to learn about the country, but I would get over that.,1,
I would find this experience very enjoyable. I  love learning about new cultures and countries. I would find it very interesting to work with a foreign client. This would expand my horizons a lot.,1,
I would find it enjoyable. I love the culture and history of Western nations and I would be happy to have a reason to dive more deeply into Norway. I would be fascinated to learn more about their past and present.,1,
I'd find it enjoyable. I would also hope that if we got the client, I'd be the person who gets to travel and meet with the client in Norway. I enjoy learning about different countries and cultures and would be thankful for that opportunity.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable.  I would learn things about the country and culture.  I would even be willing to do some traveling.,1,
I would preferred to be able to travel to Norway. However, this will still be an exciting, and educational experience to learn more about the culture there. I would eagerly looking forward to this assignment.,1,
It would depend on whether it could be beneficial for my career.  Although enjoyable, I may have more pressing issues.   This would be the determining factor.,1,
I would not find the experience enjoyable because I don't want to learn about a place I can't travel to. I'd be a bit disappointed but I'd probably still volunteer. This isn't my type of thing, though.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable, because I enjoying learning about new cultures and information about foreign places. It will be very helpful in winning the client over and can be of great use in the future.,1,
For me it is a good opportunity to know more about this country, its culture and its people. I do not mind this participation in this project at all. I like to get out of my everyday routine and learn something.,1,

I would find it enjoyable. I'd be able to learn new things about a different culture, with the possibility of even traveling there. It'd be best to travel there and show the client how far you'd go for them. Learning about their country and culture might open up possibilities for other potential clients from that country as well.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable. I enjoy learning about new countries and cultures. This would give me an opportunity to learn about Norway and could possibly lead to a trip there, either through this project or simply on my own reconnaissance. This would also give me a push to pursue my interest in other countries.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable. It's always good to learn new things - be it trivia or more practical information. The experience may introduce customs or practices that prove beneficial either directly or indirectly, in business or otherwise. Showing initiative and willingness to adapt to the job at hand may benefit future job aspirations.,1,
I would find it enjoyable, although I would much prefer being able to travel as part of the opportunity. However, even just learning about a different culture may provide something different and interesting.,1,
I would find it enjoyable. I enjoy interacting with people from other cultures. I would use the experience to try and learn about another culture. I'd try and find some local places that display the American values well.,1,
I would find it somewhat enjoyable - but not as enjoyable as if I could also travel to Norway.  I would ask specifics about what I would be required to do.  I would also ask what criteria would be used to determine if travel was necessary.,1,
I would volunteer for sure. I find it exciting. I love to learn new things and it would make you more useful to the company to volunteer to be on the project. It would expand your horizons and make you look good to your superiors. Plus, maybe you would get to go to Norway someday or get in on more special protects in the future!,1,

I would find this experience enjoyable, because it would be fun to work on an international project. It's something different from what I'd usually do at work and would be a nice change of pace. I would also be able to show off my willingness to be proactive at work.,1,
I would find it interesting. I am not opposed to the work required. I am here to do what needs to be done and this project needs my efforts.,1,
I would find this very enjoyable. Even if I did not get to travel, it would be really fun to get immersed in another type of culture. Maybe if I worked hard enough, it would turn into a travel opportunity.,1,
I would enjoy learning about another country and their culture.  It would be enjoyable in that way.  It would also possibly open up new opportunities.,1,
I would like to explore the opportunity. I would be keenly interested in learning new things, language, culture. Also I would not mind in spending some time on Norway if required. I would not miss the opportunity,1,
I would because  I like to learn new things. I like to learn about different cultures and ways of living. I would find it very interesting,1,
I would not find this experience enjoyable unless I am paid to travel. Doing research for a country you will never go to is boring in my opinion. I will let someone else take the job while I plan my own vacation to Norway. If another colleague is not up to the task, I can at least tell my bosses I've been to Norway and learn a lot from my stay.,1,
I would enjoy learning about Norway. I would find it an interesting and pleasurable diversion from the routine duties of my job.

I would find this to be pretty interesting, yeah. It's always fun to learn about other cultures. Even if it's motivated by the company dealing with a client, experiencing other cultural differences is fun. I don't really like to travel either, so if I could get some experience with Norway without actually having to go there, that'd be pretty cool.,1,
I think it would be an interesting project.  I also think it would be a good idea to travel.  Saying that, I do not think I would take the project.,1,

I would find it enjoyable to be involved.  I love to learn about new cultures.  I think it would be educational.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. It would be interesting to learn new things. I would welcome the opportunity even if I didn't get to travel.,1,
I would certainly volunteer for the project. I have long been interested in the Nordic countries and would love to learn more about Norway - especially if I was getting paid to do it. I am good at learning new information quickly, and there is lots available about this country. It would be an enjoyable diversion from my regular daily duties.,1,
I would find this experience incredibly enjoyable! Traveling, experiencing different cultures, learning about new languages and cultures has always been interesting to me!,1,
I would find it very enjoyable and exciting.  I love learning about different cultures.  I would try to study a little and use anything I learned in my conversations with the client.  I might also ask to visit them in Norway to facilitate our business relationship.  I love travel.,1,
I would find the experience very boring. Since it is volunteer work, it is completely on your own with no pay. It would be more interesting if you did get to travel, but since you just need to learn the culture for no pay, I would not.,1,
I would look at this experience as an opportunity to learn something new. I think it would be enjoyable to spend some work time learning about another country. It would probably be enjoyable because it would be something out of the norm and I like to learn about different cultures anyway.,1,

I would find this experience really really enjoyable and would welcome it with open hand to learn about our new client and country so if other projects  of this sort comes up I am positioned to take it immediately,1,
I would most definitely find this experience enjoyable. I'd love to speak with and learn from a Norwegian client. I strongly believe in being a life long student and everyone can learn something from someone.,1,
I would find the experience mixed.  I'm not really interested in learning about other cultures or countries, however, to look good for the company and my boss I'd volunteer.  Either way I feel volunteering is a good thing because the deal was closed with a client from Norway which can only have positive impacts.,1,
I would love to be involved in this project - especially if I got to travel. I'm woefully ignorant when it comes to the customs and culture of Norway, and I'd enjoy having the opportunity to learn. Hopefully I can expand my horizons a little bit,1,
I would gladly welcome a new opportunity to help the organization with a new client. Additionally, I would enjoy learning about a country and culture unfamiliar to me. The ability to participate in the project without the travel requirement would make involvement less stressful.,1,
I would think it would be fun.  As long as I didn't have to travel. I would enjoy learning about another culture.  I would like to increase my knowledge.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable because I like learning about other cultures. I also know a little about Norway and would love to learn more. I would also think volunteering would look good for me at work.,1,
I would not take this only because it takes way too much effort. Learning a whole new culture seems like a hassle.  I would rather travel and learn the culture as I arrive.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. I do like to learn new things and have the opportunity to share the information. I would consider it a pro to learn these new things, but not actually have to leave home and travel to Norway.,1,
I would definitely find the trip enjoyable experience. An experience that I probably would never do this on my own. I would be so excited to go and heavily ready to learn. I would search and read anything I can about the country and see about the culture. Make sure I read up on what not to do while I am there and where to not go. Make sure I read up on the dangerous parts of the country. I find it will be exciting giving the opportunity to travel even if it was for business. And learning anything new would be fun.,1,
I would find the experience of learning about a new culture very exciting. I would be happy to volunteer for this project as it would not only help to show my initiative to my company, it would help expand my world view. I would be gaining personal development while helping my company, it's a win-win.,1,
I would enjoy this experience. I am always into trying new things and learning new things. People of different backgrounds are interesting to me. Traveling would be fun too.,1,
I would probably volunteer to show my boss that I can be depended on to go that extra step. Hopefully I would find it interesting. If it proved to be boring I wouldn't do as through a job.,1,
I would find this experience very interesting. I like to interact with people from other cultures. Scandinavian culture is amazing. And if I have to travel I would be very happy.,1,
Personally I would love it. Knowledge is power and who doesn't want to learn new things. To experience a new culture new history is a great thing to me.,1,
I would find it interesting. I'd be curious and find it interesting to learn about a new culture and find out what Norway was all about. I like to learn and finding out new things would be entertaining for me.,1,
I would prefer to think carefully about it. I wouldn't make this decision very soon. Volunteering is absolutely not mandatory and my decision depends on how I'm busy with my current projects right now. If I'm not so busy, would like to agree.,1,
I would find it enjoyable. I think I would love the Norwegian culture and anything that can give me a learning experience I am all for. I would hope that it would include travel as well as it would be a joy to go to Norway,1,
That sounds incredibly enjoyable. It's fun to learn about new places, and I would be getting paid to for it. I would look forward to the new information I would encounter.,1,
I would absolutely thrilled to be paid for this experience. I think learning in general is valuable, but I would be especially interested if there is a chance to travel and engage with what I am learning about. I would definitely be the first to volunteer!,1,
I think it would be a very enjoyable experience and I would love to be part of as I like research work and I enjoy learning about different countries.,1,
I would find it enjoyable!  It's nice to be able to do things out of the ordinary.  Learning things about a country and culture sounds enjoyable to me - no matter whether or not I get to travel there.  I'm furthering my own knowledge which will only benefit myself (and the client).,1,
I would find this interesting but I would be even more interseting if I got to travel to Norway too.  I would want to learn something new about a country and culture.  I would like to be paid to work on a project like this.,1,
I would find this enjoyable because I like taking on more responsibility. I would be up for travel if needed. I would also enjoy learning about the country and culture.,1,
I would find it enjoyable. It's always interesting and stimulating to learn about a foreign country or culture. It would certainly not bore me.,1,
Depending on my current duties at work, this deal would probably be incredibly enjoyable. The break from things to learn about something new (especially on company time) sounds awesome. Doubly so if the project includes traveling to Norway. If anything, it adds something fun to incorporate into my resume.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable.  I like learning about other peoples cultures and experiences.  I like seeing how other people see the world through a different filter than I do based on their cultural background and experiences.  I would find this task very enjoyable.,1,

I would find this experience enjoyable. I enjoy learning about other countries and their cultures. I'm interested in the differences and similarities of other cultures. Overall, this would be a great learning experience.,1,
I don't think I'd mind volunteering for the project depending on what would be involved. If I needed to learn the language, it would take time. I would need more details about what my responsibilities would be. Also, could travel be requested to meet the client face-to  face?,1,
I think the experience is fun. I want to know about the country. I will do a good job at the learning and it is going to be nice.,1,
I would find this to be an enjoyable experience. I would be excited to stimulate my brain and learn something new. I would make the time to research Norway and the local customs.

I would fine the experience enjoyable. I have always been interested in Norway as I have Norwegian heritage. My mother shared some Norwegian culture when I was a  child and it would be interesting to learn more about that. I would also like to add to my knowledge of the culture.,1,
I would find it enjoyable. I would get to learn about a new place on the company dime. I also may get to travel if that becomes necessary.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable because I would be learning a lot about a different culture. I would be able to experience a whole bunch of new things and especially new cuisine.

I would find this experience to be enjoyable as I like learning about other cultures. I would also like this opportunity so that I may add this to my resume for career enhancement. I would also ask how this project would interfere with work as well. I would not like to be a part of the project if it is on personal time and not compensated.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. In spite of not necessarily travelling, I am always open to learning more about other countries and their culture. As well, it would likely bring me more prestige in the company.,1,
I would find it very interesting. My kids are grown and on their own, so it's like I have all the time in the world to learn something new. Even if I didn't get to travel, I would still learn something. There is a whole world out there and we need to embrace it.,1,
I would love to do this project. I love learning about different cultures and to meet different kinds of people. This would be a wonderful experience for me that I would enjoy greatly.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable because I love learning about other countries, people, and cultures. I often search up this info on the web. I get pleasure out of learning about other cultures and the interesting things people do in other countries.,1,
I would probably find this enjoyable, merely because I don't have to travel. And if I don't have to travel, I probably don't need to meet the client in person either. Learning and experiencing new things and new culture, without having to set foot in another country, sounds fun.,1,
I would be hesitant to learn about the country. I would be hesitant because that’s an awful lot of work for somebody who might not be a client forever and I feel like it’s not necessarily important information that affects my life personally and I already have other things going on so I don’t think I would want to waste my free time learning about that.,1,
I would find it very enjoyable. I would like to research about the country and it will give me something constructive to do in my spare time. I would also see if traveling in an option and be willing to travel there if I could be compensated but otherwise still be happy about the research.,1,

I would find it enjoyable because it is a new country that I don't know much about. I think it would be interesting to learn new things.  I would also think that it is good that I don't have to travel there.,1,
I would think that it would be a bit boring. I dont get to travel to Norway just learn about it. I guess it would be a plus for me when talking with the company from Norway but I think it would be boring.,1,
I would find it very enjoyable. I love learning things from other cultures. I would read up on their customs and try authentic foods. It would be a lot of fun to be a part if this project.,1,

I would definitely find it enjoyable. I am fan of learning about other cultures and think this would be a good opportunity to do that. I also like that there is a chance that I could get to travel there and that would make it more fun.,1,
Actually, I would be very interested in being involved in the project. I enjoy learning about other countries and cultures and this would be a excellent opportunity to both learn about Norweigan culture and develop a closer relationship with the client. In addition, it presents an opportunity to serve as something of an ambassador of the United States to show ourselves in a positive way to our client and, thereby, strengthen our relationship.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. I would experience new things which I usually don't get to do. I would immerse myself.,1,
would find it enjoyed. It is always good to cross culterate. I enjoy new learning,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable and would want to volunteer to be involved on the project.  Having the opportunity to learn a new language, culture and a country while being paid to do so is wonderful.  I would also express interest in traveling if it would help.  Showing a willingness to improve yourself to your managers, to learn new skills and being open to new experiences should be seen positively by management as well as helping my career later in life.,1,
I would like to study about Norway. I would work on textbooks, read articles online, anything. I would study the language and find it enjoyable. It means helping the company out and possibly future clients from Norway.,1,
I would find it enjoyable. I would like to learn about Norway. I like new countries and cultures.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable, because usually foreign clients mean travel and learning about new cultures. And I would attempt to get some travel time, if necessary. I like to travel, even if it's outside the stuffy confines of my home office. So I would definitely enjoy this experience.,1,
I would find it very enjoyable. I love experiencing new cultures. i would also offer to travel.,1,
I would find it enjoyable. This gives me a chance to learn new things. Understand another country and their culture and origin.,1,
I would love this experience. I have actually traveled a lot to work and been in countries like brazil where i did not know the language. I would first find out everything i could about the places i would be going, the language, culture, customs, etc..,1,
I would find it enjoyable.  I like learning about other cultures and it would be interesting to deal with these people.  Also, I would love the oppurtunity to travel if it presents itself in the future.,1,
I would find this experience very enjoyable.  I enjoy traveling and learning about things to use for this project.  I would like to work with people from Norway on this project.,1,
Yes of course, I would find this experience enjoyable, and perhaps even go to Norway for future job prospects. Looking and learning different aspects of culture intrigues me, and part of me wishes I could experience them. Going and studying Norway might also open up new doors for business opportunity at home as well.,1,
I would be thrilled to work on this deal. I love learning about other countries and cultures, and interacting with people from them. I would love to travel to Norway and, even though this particulare project would not require me to, it might lead to future projects with the company which would allow me to travel there.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable.  In general, I enjoy using both objective facts and my own subjective perceptions to try to understand others' positions. I'd welcome the opportunity to learn more about Norway, and I'd consider myself lucky that I might benefit at my job from doing well at such a task.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. I always take delight in learning new things, especially about new cultures. There is always something to gain in learning new things.,1,
i would enjoy this experience. I enjoy learning new things and my family is from Sweden and I like learning about that culture. My husbands family is from Norway and I think he would enjoy me learning and letting him know as well. there is so much to learn in this world,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable.  I like learning about other cultures.  I find it is both pleasurable, and it brings a deeper understanding of humanity.  The more you learn, the more connections you make across topics, and the better you understand people.  This helps you make better decisions.,1,
I probably would find this situation somewhat stressful. I do not enjoy traveling for work so if traveling was involved I would not be excited about this. I think learning about the country would be somewhat interesting however, the traveling part would not be. It would depend on what all was involved.,1,
I would probably find it enjoyable because I love to learn new things about countries.  It would be an experience for me that would broaden my knowledge.  It could also be useful to me in the future especially in my career.,1,
I would volunteer! I love learning new languages and learning about other cultures is a great way to expand your mind. I would find this very fun and enjoyable. I would buy a lot of books on NORWAY and look up everything I could on the internet.,1,
I would find this very exciting.  I like to learn about new cultures and would like to travel there if helpful.  I would be very excited to be involved in this project to both help the deal and learn somethings about Norway.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable.  I think that it is beneficial to learn about other countries and cultures.  It also does not appear to be an overly difficult responsibility.,1,
I would find this project to enjoyable. Learning about other cultures for work would be awesome. It's not everyday that everyone gets to be involved in something like this. And there could be a possibility of traveling to Norway, you never know.,1,
I would probably find it boring. I wouldn't want to dedicate my time to a culture that I don't care too much about. It wouldn't be worth my time.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable I believe. I enjoy learning about new things. It would be interesting learning about the people, culture and environment. I'm sure I would learn some fascinating facts.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable.  Learning about other countries is very excited and opens your minds to new things.  This will also give me an oppotunity to learn about Norway just in case I do have a chance to visit one day.,1,
I would find this experience slightly enjoyable. I would like to learn more about Norway, but it would seem kind of pointless if it doesn't actually involve traveling to the country. I would much prefer to travel there.,1,
I would absolutely enjoy this opportunity. I love learning about other cultures. Also, volunteering to be a part of any project looks good so I would take the opportunity whether it was boring or not.,1,
I would think it would be interesting to learn the culture of a different country.  I also think anytime you can volunteer for extra things it will only help your outlook the boss has for you.  I would want to make sure my supervisor knows that the company is important to me through my volunteering efforts.,1,
I would find this very enjoyable as I have long been fascinated with the culture and natural beauty of Norway and Scandinavia in general.  Some of my favorite authors and tv shows are Norwegian and I am fascinated by the landscape.  Some of the natural beauty of Norway is unmatched anywhere else in the world.  They are a very forward thinking people and are attempting to find solutions to problems in society in a rational way.,1,
Oh, I'd love this assignment! I'd do research and learn as much as I can about the culture. I'd feel honored to be chosen for this assignment!,1,
I would enjoy it. Norway with the Viking traditions. It would totally be great for me. But if I had to learn all the new information I would insist on a real-life trip.,1,
I would find it enjoyable. The reason is that it's fun to learn about other people and cultures. That may lead to someday being asked to actually travel there for my work or leisure.,1,
I would be very excited by this. I love working with people from around the world, and I love learning new languages and cultures. Opportunities like this are my dream.,1,
I would find such an experience interesting and enjoyable. Getting paid to learn about another country seems like a great opportunity to me. Since I often try to learn such things on my own time, this is the rare chance to do so and draw a paycheck at the same time.,1,
I would find it very interesting and exciting to travel to another country for work.  Even if I wasn't able to travel, learning about a completely different culture would very enjoyable to me.  I tend to like learning about other cultures in my spare time, so having it be a part of work would be very beneficial for me.,1,
I would find it enjoyable. the part about not traveling helps make the decision easier. There are also benefits to learning about another culture and people.,1,
It might be enjoyable, new experiences frequently are. It would likely be more enjoyable if it did involve travel. But then again, we are talking about Norway.,1,
I would find it enjoyable. I would really love if there would be some traveling involved, but I love learning about new places. I think it would be great to step out of the boundaries of a normal project and experience new things.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. I have always liked learning about new cultures and customs, so it would be an enjoyable project for me. It would also further my relationship with our clients and show them that I am willing to go above and beyond to grow our relationship. Since I don't have to travel, it would only add a few more hours to my workload and would only benefit myself and the company.,1,
I would find this experience incredibly enjoyable. I would absolutely volunteer for the project. I think learning about other cultures is fascinating and a valuable use of my time. This could be an opportunity to score points at work and enrich myself at the same time.,1,
I am somewhat like a data vacuum, so the chance to study the language, history and culture of Norway would be delightful. However, I am a settler not a pilgrim so under no circumstance would I who has no passport ever consider leaving my home town. Beyond studying the lay of the land, there are surely a variety of other ways to work on the project but it would be important for the principals on the project to know I do not travel.,1,
I would love the opportunity to work with the client from Norway. What more could you ask for than to broaden your horizons and learn about another country. International experience would look good on my record.,1,
I would find this interesting to some extent. If it involved traveling to the new country and spending some time there to learn about the country and people, it would have been more exciting. However, I'll still volunteer for this and try to learn more about it through websites and online videos.,1,
I would probably find it boring, especially if no travel was offered. Why would I be finding out this information on a volunteer basis? How would it advance my career? Would I be a liaison to the client?,1,
I would definitely volunteer to be a part of this opportunity to learn more about this client and other country.  I think any people you meet have stories and things to share which will broaden your own mind and knowledge.  Helping out someone from another country can also be a personally rewarding experience.  I think it is just the right thing to do and it would be enjoyable to learn from someone else.,1,
I would volunteer. It would be enjoyable because it would be different than my everyday duties. It might also be a challenge, and help me improve my skills. I would like it even more if I did have the opportunity to travel and visit the country.,1,
I would love this opportunity as I love to learn about other cultures. On the side I love to travel, and although this doesn't necessarily involve travel, I would definitely focus on learning the information about my clients culture as much as I could.,1,
I would find this to be fasinating.  I would love to volunteer.  I would learn a lot.,1,
I would fine this experience enjoyable. It would be fun to learn about another culture and then exercise that knowledge in front of others. I would definitely volunteer for this because knowledge is power and there is never anything bad about learning.,1,
I like to find out about all i can from different countries and i would really enjoy and find out everything i could about norway  and try to run with it in some presentations,1,
Learning about Norway might be fun. It does sound like this company asks an awful lot of me though. i would probably try to do this since the deal is already closed. It may not be too stressful.,1,
I would probably enjoy it.  Anything that I can do that would add value and experience to myself is always good.  I can add this information on a resume and learn some things about how a particular client does business.  Any chance I had to get my name out there as a go getter is something I view as a good decision.,1,
I'd find it enjoyable because I love learning about other cultures. I appreciate extra projects at work because it shows that my employers trust me to do well. It also gives me experience that may benefit me later somehow.,1,
I would enjoy this.  I like learning about new cultures and people.  I've always been fascinated with Norway and this would give me an excuse to explore it, at least research it.,1,
I would not be interested in the project. I might be more interested in the project if I was not the head of the project. I like to be more behind the scenes and not be the one who would be in trouble if there was anything that happened.,1,
I would love the opportunity to work with someone from another country.  I have a real passion for other cultures so I would be the first one to volunteer.  I would look at this as an opportunity to connect and learn something and maybe give me more information for a day when I can go to Norway for a vacation.,1,
I would try to avoid this, because I don't have time usually between school work and other life necessities. So I would pass on the opportunity not because of being boring but because time management is not fully efficient in my life.,1,
I would love to learn new things about another culture and location, even though I was not going to travel there.  I would find this a learning experience that is positive. IT would be great!,1,
I would definitely find this to be enjoyable. I would love to learn things about the country and culture of Norway. I would even offer to travel if need be.,1,
I would find this very enjoyable. The prospect of learning about a new culture and learning new things excites me. Plus I could use the aforementioned vacation time to go to Norway and learn even more.,1,
I would love it. I really enjoy learning about other cultures. I think Norway is a very interesting country.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable.  I think that learning about another country and culture as part of work is something that would be ejoyable and maybe entertaining.  I think that the opportunity to learn more is a good thing and would help me overall as a person, not just in this work setting.  I would not really want to travel, and would hope that I didn't have to travel, but it says the person wouldn't necessairly need to travel.  So as long as I didn't have to travel, I would find this enjoyable.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable because I like to learn about other cultures, perspectives, ways of living, and other countries. It would also provide me the opportunity to make friendships and relationships with people from other countries. In the end, I may be asked to travel to Norway to represent my company, and this learning opportunity will allow me to prepare for these international business meetings. I would definitely volunteer to be involved in this kind of project as it could be a once in a lifetime opportunity.,1,
I would find this interesting and boring. Learning another culture is the best thing i love to do but without meeting those people, travelling and seeing it with your own eyes, learning it makes it boring and I might not like it. But if travelling and meeting face to face I will go for it.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable as long as I didn't have to travel. I like learning about different places and customs, but travel is impractical with a young family. I would enjoy learning about a way of life that's different from mine and better understanding the world.,1,
I think I would find it enjoyable. I like learning about other countries and cultures. I think my eagerness to learn would help me to be enthusiastic and eager to do a good job on the project. I actually hope that there would be an opportunity to travel to Norway during the project.,1,
I would definitely find this an enjoyable experience. I have lived abroad a good deal and value learning about other cultures and countries. I could imagine few better opportunities. I would definitely seek the chance to expand what I know of the world.,1,
I would find the experience intriguing but I would be unlikely to take it. I personally tend to enjoy sticking around home and all of the people in my life. I also have a lot of commitments around my city and would hate to have to go back on some of those. I would therefore not want to take the experience as I feel I would be losing more than I was gaining.,1,
I would find this experience immensely enjoyable. Even without the need to travel, I love to learn about other cultures and countries. I think that it would enrich me, as a person.,1,
I would probably find it enjoyable.  First I would learn of another culture and second I would be assisting the company for the good.  This seem like a win-win situation as far as I am concerned.,1,
I would find this experience very enjoyable. I like learning about different cultures, and I also like learning new languages. I imagine in this role, I would have to learn about Norwegian culture extensively, and presumably learn at least some terms in the language, which I would find enjoyable. I also enjoy interacting with clients, so if the project involved client interaction I would enjoy that as well.,1,
I would find this enjoyable. Despite not traveling it would be interesting to learn about a different country. It would also be a chance to interact with a different business culture.,1,
I would love to learn more about Norway! I'd volunteer to be involved if the task is within the scope of my abilities and I would most likely find the task very enjoyable (unless the project is entirely made up of extremely unexciting routine work). I'd also volunteer to travel, even in winter. I've never been there and I like new experiences.,1,
I would find it very enjoyable. I love the idea of learning about new cultures and people. Also, it would put me in a position to become involved in other projects with additional clients from Norway. I could even get to travel - on the company dime - there some day.,1,
I would not find this enjoyable, especially not being paid for doing it. I never volunteer, especially for my employer. And I sure wouldn't waste my time learning country and culture things that I have no interest in.,1,
I like to travel and I find learning about new people, culture and places is exciting. I would overall enjoy this and be happy to go to a new place. I would prefer a warmer place.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. While it is not necessary to travel, I could use the experience to learn more about the culture and to broaden my horizons. It could give me an insight of the outside world, and give me an appreciation of the differences on earth.,1,
I would probably enjoy it.  I am sure most would.  I would not do it because I have way to much going on in my life.  I am not going to add anymore onto my plate then I already have and take away time from my family.,1,
I would find the experience very enjoyable because it would be nice to travel to a place like Norway that I had never visited. Even though I would be going for work it would be a new experience that I may not get to have otherwise.,1,
I would find the experience boring because i would just have to narrate everything to him about the country's culture without showing the real deal to him.,1,
I would find it very enjoyable to learn about a new country and culture.  I would be nervous, because the last thing I would want to do is offend our client due to ignorance of their culture and norms.  I would hope to be an excellent ambassador for our company and to be a trusted representative for our client.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable, as I generally enjoy learning new things and taking on challenging projects.

I would really find it as a good experience. I would also enjoy in doing so. There is even no travel involved and i will be more happy in saying greatness about my country and culture to other people.,1,

I would no doubt volunteer for this project, because other cultures fascinate me and i never let go a opportunity to learn something new.  It is always a good idea to take free knowledge when given the chance. The only thing that disappoints is not being able to actually go to Norway.,1,

I would like to travel as a part of the project so that I would be able to get a physical feel of the country for myself. I think learning about the country would elevate the project.,1,
I would want to volunteer for this assignment becuase learning about another culture would be very interesting. Even if travel is not involved, I feel it could be bennifical to me to learn from this client and help make their experience better. Any time there is an opportunity to break up the normal workday with something new and different would be enjoyable to anyone.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable, as my lineage takes me back to Norway, any excuse to learn about the country and culture is a plus. Additionally, knowing about the country and culture will help when dealing with the clients from that country, and allow you to have a better rapport with them as business continues.,1,
I would find it enjoyable.  One of the things I love to do is travel, and learn about new cultures.  Although I do not have to travel, you never know what will happen in the future.  If I show my supervisors how knowledgeable I have become regarding the client, in the future I may just get selected to go to Norway if the opportunity arose.,1,
I would find the experience really fun and interesting. That's because I love learning more about other cultures and countries. Of course I wouldn't be travelling in this job, but the fact that I would still get to learn about Norwegian culture and way of life etc is an incentive / motivation for me.,1,
I would find it a god experience because it would let me experience a different part of the world that i had never seen before. It would be good to help learn about how companies in other parts of the world do bussiness.,1,
I would find this experience boring.  I have no interest in other countries and cultures.  I would not be the right person for this project.,1,
I wouldn't find it enjoyable or boring.  I guess I would classify it as uninteresting.  I'm really not into learning the culture of different countries.  I would turn out the offer.,1,

I think that could help greatly in personal development for work and general development in encountering different situations.,1,
I would find this experience to be enjoyable. I would enjoy learning this about the country and culture. It would also push me out my comfort zone so that is a major plus.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. I have heard a lot about Norway and the people. By the way, I like having new and awesome experiences. I would volunteer to be part of this project. While working with clients, I have found few projects that were boring.,1,
I would find this enjoyable. I have an interest in other cultures and countries. I would like to learn more about Norway.,1,
I would volunteer and break out the books. Anything you learn about the culture and client will be useful in the future. Even if you do not have a direct use for the knowledge later on it will broaden your horizons and make you a more well rounded person,,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. I like learning about new countries and learning in general. It would be fun to learn about a country that is probably very different from mine. I would take that opportunity in a heartbeat.,1,
I think it would be alot of fun. I love to learn about other cultures and also travel if needed. It would also show a willingness to take on work and be a team player.,1,
I would find it highly enjoyable because I love to learn about other cultures. Not only would it be enjoyable to me but it would be fascinating and a great chance to learn about Norwegians.

I would find it very interesting because I like learning about different cultures. I would definitely like not having to travel there except maybe rarely so that would help. I would likely learn new skills and insights by taking on this project.,1,
I would find it enjoyable.  I am always up to learning new things and learn about new cultures.  I feel taking on the responsibility will also look good for me in the future.,1,
I wouldnt be too excited about this experience. I wouldn't really enjoy learning all of the stuff without actually being able to travel to the country.,1,
I would agree that unfamiliar things may seem undesirable at first. However, as you become less ignorant, you realize there is rich culture all around. I would keep an open mind as I work with the client,1,
I would be thrilled to be chosen for the project. My family is from Norway, and it would be a wonderful fit for me. I would find it a very enjoyable experience. In addition, I like to learn about other cultures, so I would be a good fit for the project no matter what country the client was in.,1,
I would love this.  I love to learn about other countries.  I've been to Denmark so would want to learn more about Norway.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable, as I generally like to learn about other places and cultures. I would be more interested if travel was involved as I also would like to travel abroad more. Learning about and experiencing other cultures are things I do in my free time, so doing them as a part of work would be an added benefit.,1,
I would find the experience very enjoyable, depending on the client's personality and attitude.  I enjoy meeting new people and I love new experiences.  I also travel locally a lot so I would adequately be able to host this client.,1,
I would find it quite enjoyable. I find other countries and cultures intriguing. Such experiences expand our worldview and make us global citizens. I would be willing to put in extra effort on this task, not only for the benefit of the company, but also for my growth.,1,
I would find it very enjoyable. I would volunteer for the project and start learning about Norway. I would visit the library to check out the appropriate books and go to the bookstore to find additional materials to learn about Norway.,1,
I would find the experience both enjoyable and boring. While it doesn't present an ideal destination, the opportunity could be used to advance within the company if successful. It is also a great opportunity to find a unique task to put on the resume that could differentiate myself as a candidate on future applications.,1,
If it involves some other incentive that would be something I would volunteer for. I would be interested to learn about Norwegian culture. But there would have to be an incentive. My time and effort is not free. No one's is.,1,
I would love this opportunity. I am interested in other cultures and the chance to learn new things. I am particularly interested in norway. i just recently read a history book on nordic culture. i think i would do really well on this project.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. It's always fun to learn new things about other cultures, and Norway is a fascinating country. Part of this would also depend on who I'd have to work with and what the project entails, but the learning part itself sounds like fun.,1,
I would find it enjoyable. I like to learn new things and be given New opportunities. This is also a good opportunity for visibility and growth.,1,

I would be glad to volunteer for the project. I love traveling and learning more about different cultures. The experience would also result in both personal and professional growth.,1,

I would find this experience enjoyable. I find it interesting to learn about different cultures, and I would love the opportunity to not only learn about another culture, but to be able to help my company through that learning. It sounds like a fun way to learn some new things and meet some people from another country.,1,
Boring. I'd like to know more about Norway, but not necessarily to devote a huge block of time to it. And especially not so much of my time it would be to the exclusion of other things. Besides, most of the stuff I learned would probably be about the business aspects, which would be boring.,1,
I VERY UPSET IN THIS SITUATION BECAUSE OF THE TIMING OF THE TRAVEL WILL MAKE MANY OF THE WILLING THINGS AND THE IMPORTANT THINGS TO ABOUT THE COUNTRY.  IT MAKES ME SOME OF THE IMPORTANT ABOUT THE COUNTRY BUT THE TIME I REALLY MISS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR IT. SO IT IS VERY BAD FOR ME,1,
I would find it enjoyable. I love learning about other countries and cultures. Even though it doesn't seem to be required, I would go out of my way to learn the Norwegian language.,1,
I would not volunteer to represent our company to a new client. I work better in the background. My asset to the company is in being one of the invisible detailers, we shine as a group. I wouldn't find it at all boring but moreso, fearful and possibly enjoyable but would not wish to represent.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. Why I would choose this is because this is an opportunity for growth and development. And would be a great challenge.,1,

I would definitely volunteer for the project. I would think it would be interesting and informative.,1,
I would find it exciting. I would go out of my way to try to show them what I can whether they are around or they still havent come. I think it is exciting to be able to share your culture and things about your country. It may interest and excite people and I think that is something to be proud of.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable, especially if I would actually be able to do the traveling. But even with no travel, it would be enjoyable to meet with the customers from Norway, discuss their culture and country, and more specifically their business that they belong to. Doing so would certainly ensure a well-functioning relationship and successful project.,1,
I would find it quite enjoyable. Research is something I relish and I would take this on with no problem.,1,
I would likely find it enjoyable as I enjoy learning about different countries and cultures and it is good knowledge to have in case I ever meet other Norwegians or want to visit some day. Learning about new things that may or may not be interesting are always going to come up in life so finding ways to make it interesting is always a good idea.,1,
I would be willing to lead the new project because I am always interested in having new knowledge about new territories and that way when I travel I can talk to local people with greater property and understanding,1,
Yes, I would find that enjoyable. It would be interesting to learn about a different country and culture that I am not familiar with. Even without the travel, I would find an international project interesting.,1,
I would find it interesting because I like learning about other countries and cultures. I would find it irresistibly interesting if it means I get something out of volunteering later say for instance...a harder look come promotion time or raise time.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. It is very interesting to learn things about another country and culture. It would be all right not to travel, but it would be even more exciting to actually be in the country. I don't see how this project could possibly be boring.,1,

I would love a chance to do something like that! I think it would be incredibly interesting. I love learning about other countries and cultures. If I were given the opportunity to travel there, I would jump on it. International travel is my favorite kind of travel.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. I am curious about other countries and cultures. I think that it will help my company and help my future with the company.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable. I am always open to learning new things and have never been outside of the US. I would request to travel if possible and would enjoy the research either way.,1,
I would find it enjoyable.  It is again an opportunity for a career advancement.  This scenario assumes they are the first client from Norway, and should my company want to expand their business in Norway, I would want to be the leader and most knowledgeable on the subject.,1,
I would find it very enjoyable. I like to learn about different cultures. I find other cultures really interesting. I love to travel so I would be hoping that there would be the possibility of travel involved in the project.,1,
I'd find it enjoyable. I like learning new things about different countries and cultures. It would be great to work on a new project with new people. It would also be a great way to make international contacts.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. I think that learning about different countries and cultures can help you to understand people better. It also makes you look at things from a different perspective from your own culture.,1,
I would absolutely love this experience.  It is always exciting, not to mention a great opportunity to grow when you learn about other cultures. And again, you never know what lies in the future, the stuff that I get to learn from this deal may lead to other things.,1,
I would love to and would because it would be a great and enjoyable opportunity as I love learning about new cultures. I love stuff like this and would actively take on this role.,1,
I would find it very enjoyable. I love learning about new people and places. Please send me to Norway!,1,
I would feel that this experience would be a little boring to be honest. If there are no travel incentives in conjunction to what I have to learn concerning the client's country, then I don't see the point. I feel like learning about their culture is rather just a scapegoat situation where a subordinate would learn their customs and culture to be the spokesperson for the company.,1,
I would volunteer to be involved in the project myself.  I think it would be a great learning experience for me to learn about other country and its culture.  This will help me advance in my career and you never know that in the future it will help me build my portfolio.,1,
I would enjoy the experience of learning about a new country and culture. It's always fun to continue learning about new things.,1,
Enjoyable. Norway is a country I would probably like to learn more about since it is relatively unfamiliar to me. I would not have a problem learning more about the culture.,1,
I would find it very enjoyable. I was an anthropology major in college, so this type of situation is right up my alley. I love learning new viewpoints and customs, and sharing mine. I think this would be a great chance to improve my personal relationship with the client, while engaging in tasks that I find interesting. I wouldn't mind travel either, if it came up, as I think traveling for business is a great way to travel, but cheaply!,1,
I would be excited to embrace the challenge. It would be a great experience for me on the professional side and also give me a chance to see the world. I think it could help my career as well.,1,
I would find this boring. I like to travel by my choice and to destinations of my choosing. I would not want to have to learn new things unless it was something I was interested in.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. Learning about other cultures can be an interesting and enlightening experience. I would be happy to take on more tasks at work to learn more.,1,
it would be an enjoyable task. it would be fun to learn about another culture and information about them. it could provide more opportunities at work.,1,
I would find this experience pretty enjoyable. I would get to learn about a new culture. It also helps improve my general work life experience.,1,
That would be a great opportunity, learn about a new country, new culture, and possible language while being paid? Can you ask for something else? Hopefuly make my way and earn a trip there.,1,
I would like to do this project. I would find it interesting and enjoyable. This is because I am always interested in learning about new people and places.,1,
I would think it is very cool! I would love something like this, I find it very interesting.,1,
I enjoy reading and learning so I would definitely find this opportunity to be enjoyable. It would be a challenging task that I would take on. I think it would be great to have a client from another country and learning the culture would be fun,1,
I would jump at the chance. It would not only be enjoyable to work with a new client from the start but also an excellent opportunity. I'm always interesting in learning more about different cultures. Being exposed to an unfamiliar culture can help to allow one to see things in a different light as well as to see things more creatively.,1,
I would find this experience a little confusing. I would need to know why I need to learn parts of their culture and what aspects of their culture. For certain things, I feel like it might be a waste of time since I am never going to travel there, but if it has to do with our company and a product being used there, that would make sense.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable because it's different from work.  I like to learn about other countries.  It would be a good excuse to try new things and new foods.,1,
I would find it exciting. I love to learn so I’d be thrilled. I’d compile as much information as possible.,1,
I would be interesting depending on what the project is. It would be something I would want to be involved in. But only if it appeals to me with further information.,1,
I would find this experience very enjoyable.  It would be very challenging also.  Learning about another country is adventurous.  Learning the language would be fun.   I think that shows how I would go the extra mile to the company.  It would be a experience and a great add to my resume.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable.  I don't know much of anything about Norway and am always looking to learn new things.  Also, it would make me look better in the eyes of the company. Someone who volunteers for new things is seen as a go getter who wants to advance.,1,
The experience would definitely be enjoyable for me to be involved in. Learning about a country and culture is an experience that I value, and would be a interesting experience for me to undertake. Traveling is not a necessity for me to be able to enjoy and learn about a culture or country, and I think the project would give me that particular opportunity. In addition, interacting with the client would give me experience and improve my skill set at performing my job.,1,
I would find this enjyoable because it would break the monotony of my every day routine. Also, I love learning about different cultures.,1,
I like learning, so I’d be good with doing the assignment.  It would be enjoyable to talk to someone from Norway.  It would be interesting to learn about that culture.,1,
I would think this is very exciting and enjoyable. I enjoy learning about other cultures and countries. It is a great learning experience and a great way to expand.,1,
I would find this to be boring, I am not really interested in learning of other peoples cultures, I might have been interested if there was the chance to go to Norway but that didn't present itself, It wouldn't be bad to travel for work.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. I would like to learn more about Norway and be able to connect with our new client. Anything that is different or outside the ordinary is something I would be interested in.,1,
I would find this enjoyable, as I would enjoy learning cultural things and having contact with people from another country. I would likely volunteer for this project.  I would also likely look for opportunities to travel.,1,
I would find it enjoyable because it's fun to learn new things. You never know when it'll come in handy. Maybe I'll be on Jeopardy and the final question is about Norway.,1,
I would find this to be an exciting project. I'd love the chance to learn about a new country and work with new people. If it required travel, I would not volunteer at this point though because I have small children at home that I can't be away from.,1,
I would find this project enjoyable, but surely challenging. It would give me a chance to learn about a culture I'm unfamiliar with, but admire. Though traveling isn't my thing, I may have to reconsider if an opportunity for travel happened to emerge, but I'd enjoy the project anyway.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable because it would be an opportunity to learn about a country and culture with which I am not too familiar. It would be interesting to meet the new client and have cultural exchange representing my company. It could also be helpful to learn about Norway in case I ever decided to travel there on vacation in the future!,1,
The experience would be enjoyable to me. I love to learn new things, and have been to Norway. I loved it there, and would love to be involved with something Norway based, even if I don't travel.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable.  It's always good to learn about other cultures, social and business norms etc.  It would also give me a chance to be an expert on something noone else in the office knows about.,1,
I believe I would find this experience ver enjoyable. I love learning about diffrent cultures from around the world. While traveling would be fun, just learning about the country would be enjoyable by itself.,1,
I would love this experience, I love learning about different countries or cultures and how wonderful it would be to do it while actually getting paid. I love to look up different cultures on the internet or read books about it.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable.  Being involved on projects, especially about other countries provides many ways to broaden my horizon.  This would also be a chance to get my name in front of other people and add it to my resume.,1,
I would be the first to volunteer for this account. I love learning about people from all over the world. I feel this project will be very enjoyable and profitable.,1,
I would be indifference about this project. I don't see it as an exciting nor boring project. I would volunteer for this project if traveling was involved because that would be exciting.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable. I love to learn about other cultures, in fact it is one of my goals in life. I would gladly volunteer to be on this project as I think it would challenge me and my knowledge would grow.,1,
I would find it enjoyable but more so if it turned into a trip. Understanding other cultures intrigues me. To learn their way of doing business, interacting, etc would not only be interesting but also good for future business interactions.,1,
I would find this experience very enjoyable!  I am always interested in learning about new cultures, especially Nordic countries.  I would hope that I could maybe get to travel there at some point, but if not, just learning about it would be great!,1,
I would find this experience to be very time consuming. I would have to spend too much time learning about the country, & it's culture. I would also probably have to learn the language as well.,1,
I would find it a lot of fun. I love learning about cultures anyway, and traveling would be a bonus. It's absolutely up my alley and I would not consider this a burden, but an opportunity.,1,
I would love to go to Norway.  I love experiencing new cultures, foods, and people.  I've been to Sweden once almost 15 years ago and love Scandinavian culture.  I want to go back. Despite the fact it would be a business trip I would still find a way to carve out some time and visit sites, and do local activities.,1,
I would find it enjoyable. I like learning about other cultures, so I’d be all for it. It sounds a lot more fun than doing real work.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable. I like to research and learn about places and cultures that I am not familiar with. I do not, however, enjoy traveling! Since this would not be a requirement, I would like to volunteer!,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. Learning about a new culture is always intriguing. Meeting the client from Norway would be interesting. I would definitely want to know the client's feelings about America.,1,
I would first have to know what things I would be learning in order to tell if it would be enjoyable or boring. But, I'd look at it as an opportunity to help the company, and myself by getting involved in it.,1,
I would find it boring. Traveling would be cool, but not this. I would still be willing to do it though.,1,
I would volunteer. I would find this experience enjoyable. I like travelling especially to elevate my cultural knowledge.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. I would find it beneficial to learn about another country, even if I didn't travel there. I am always interested in learning about different cultures.,1,
I would find it enjoyable. I think learning about a new culture would be a lot of fun, especially if no travel was required. Although I would be open to travel too, especially if I’d already learned about the culture and country.,1,
I would find it enjoyable. I love learning about different cultures and taking on new tasks. This is just combining the two and even those travel is not necessary. Who knows it still could happen.,1,
I would not volunteer. Period. I care nothing about Norway, and I do not work at a job to expand my mind. I do that on my own time, learning things that I wish to learn. It may be that I take an interest in the Norwegian culture, but it would be on my own time and by my own motivation. Trying to force me to learn something will anger me. at my last job I literally faked a hearing disability to avoid learning how to use the till so that I would not have to take customer orders. I saw no future for myself at that job, so I refused to put in effort that I did not need to.,1,
I think it would be interesting to learn about a new country and culture. I usually take the time to learn about different cultures from mine and even how to read the language if I do travel there. I think showing the client that you know or understand things about their culture could leave a lasting impression.,1,
I would find this enjoyable.  I like learning about other cultures, and just learning new things in general.  I would also hope that this would come with the possibility of travel because I would find that fun and educational.,1,
I would find it more enjoyable if there was traveling involved. It would be fun to see the country while learning about the culture. It would make it more interesting.,1,
I would find this experience interesting, not boring. I can't say whether it would be enjoyable or not at this point, but I would take on the task at hand. I would keep an open mind, and consider it a learning experience.,1,
I would find learning new things about Norway and their culture would be interesting. It would be something new and if travel were to become necessary, I would welcome that as well. I may be something to break up the normal routine of my normal job and I would enjoy that as well. Learning is never a bad thing. Definetley enjoyable.,1,
I would find it enjoyable.  It would be fun to learn something new about a country.  It would also broaden my knowledge.,1,
I wouldn't necessarily find the task either interesting or boring. I would not want to take the project because I wouldn't want to be responsible for messing up the client relationship due to a cultural issue I am not aware of.,1,
I would find this experience challenging but exciting and enjoyable.  The opportunity to expand my horizons both personally and professionally would certain help my career.  It would make me a more valuable employee.,1,

I would find this experience exhilarating! I would be eager to have a chance to travel and learn about a new country and culture, for work. It would be an opportunity for great professional and personal growth.,1,
I would find this enjoyable and would hope travel to Norway would become necessary.  It's always interesting to learn about different countries and  customs.  And since Scandinavia is basically separated from the rest of Europe it would be cool to learn about what is a unique culture.,1,
Yes I would like to do that. I already know a few things about Norway and am interested in learning more. I've met many Norwegians and generally have liked them. I've visited friends in Sweden and Finland and know a little about how things work in Scandinavian culture.,1,
I would find the task enjoyable.  I would make sure that the project plan had the time and money to support the client's involvement.  I would also make sure that there were clear ground rules regarding the client's involvement in the process.,1,
I would be indifferent about this experience. I think Norway would be an interesting place to visit, but since it isn't necessary to travel, and the information learned is purely for a better business relationship, it might be a little boring. However, having more knowledge about your clients will ultimately benefit you and the company which could lead to work-based rewards.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable. I like to learn about different countries and their cultures. I think that it would make me a more productive employee.,1,
I would find this experience to be a combination of both; in some ways it may be boring, but in others it would be enjoyable to learn about a different culture and broaden my horizons. I would lean toward it being more enjoyable because it can't hurt.,1,
I would find the experience enjoyable because it would be a lot different from my usual things. I would volunteer and try to learn new things. I don’t know much about Norway but it would be nice to learn. Learning can lead to great experiences.,1,
I would find this experience to be very enjoyable.  Not only would I learn about Norway, but I could develop networking contacts that are valuable.  This could hold me in good stead in the future.,1,

I would find the experience extremely enjoyable because doing something like this for work is very "out-of-the-norm". I would like to learn about a new culture to help the company with the project. It would be even better if I was able to go over there.,1,
I would find this experience mostly enjoyable, as I like learning about other cultures. It would also be interesting to work with a client from another country. It might be a bit boring though if I don't get to travel, as I wouldn't have that aspect to look forward to.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. I would have the opportunity to show my diversity and ability to try new things. I would be experiencing communication and knowledge about Norway that I might not outside of work. I would be expanding my contacts and might be preparing for future travel.,1,
I would find it enjoyable. I really like learning about other cultures and destinations and getting paid to do so would be a big bonus for me.,1,
I would love to have this experience. It is always a good thing to learn and be involved with new places. It would be an interesting project to work on.,1,
I would still find this task pretty enjoyable. I love learning about new things and different people or places so it would not be boring at all. I feel like a trip would be beneficial to collecting this info but not necessary. There are plenty of sources to collect this information online.,1,
I would volunteer for this project. I would push for a Norway trip. You know, to learn firsthand about the client. I enjoy other cultures. It would be exciting.,1,
I would find it super enjoyable. I would love to learn about new countries and their ways of doing things! It would be even better if I could travel there!,1,
I would find this project very intriguing. In general, I like to educate myself on different countries and cultures and, since I work with export and imports, I do get a lot of feedback and general knowledge from my foreign clients. I would totally volunteer to participate in this project because I have little knowledge about Norwegian business and I always want to grow as a person.,1,
i would actually love to do something like this. eventhough it would take a lot of time and effort, i think something like this would be fun to do. learning about new cultures and ways actually interests me so i would jump at this chance,1,
I am not fond of traveling for work, so this would not be ideal for me. I think if I did it would be nice to see how the company operates in another country.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable because I always like learning about new places and cultures. It would keep things fresh and interesting at work and allow me to network with new people. However, I would secretly hope that I'd somehow be able to travel to Norway to meet the client!,1,
I would like learning about this new culture and country. It would mix things up a bit at work, and it would keep things exciting and fresh. I am sure I would get some bonus points with my boss since I volunteered for the assignment, and yet it would also be refreshing to me.,1,
I would enjoy this experience because I would get to learn about the culture of another country. I most likely would have to learn about the history of Norway and it's people. I am already interested in history and different people, so it would be easy for me to do.,1,

I would find this experience extremely enjoyable and I would also, frankly, lobby for the opportunity to go to Norway on the company's dime! I can see no downside at all to learning about another country and culture. I would even do some of it on my own time, off the clock. I would be watching Norwegian films, reading Norwegian literature, learning some basic Norwegian language phrases such as greetings and question-asking. I would try to find a Norwegian exchange partner with whom I could meet periodically to learn about each other's cultures. This would be a lot of fun.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable because I am not fond of flying, but I am very interested in other cultures.  In this scenario, I can learn about Norway in a very personal way.  I would definitely volunteer for this project and work diligently to do justice to the opportunity.,1,
I would find it boring if no travel was involved. While learning about other cultures can be interesting, it gets much better when actually going to said place. If travel was involved, I would find it very enjoyable.,1,
I wouldn't find it enjoyable at all as I am scared to death to fly. I also hate the sea, so going by boat wouldn't work, either. Now, if I could drive there, that might be exciting.,1,
I would jump at the chance to work on on the project.  I think that experiencing a new culture would be a wonderful "adventure" for me to get involved in.  It would be a great opportunity to feel like I was part of a bigger world and have fun doing it .,1,

Boring. I am not much of a traveler especially in foreign countries. Yes it's true I would like to visit my ancestors' home country in the future, but any other countries I have no interest in. I never really also trying other types of food, I always have a specific food type that I enjoy.,1,

However, if that wasn't possible I would gladly participate in video conferencing to speak to the client one to one to get a feeling for their culture and country which would certainly add to the success of the project.,1,
I would not do it because its not getting me any money. I would not waste time doing things like that when i can be painting and making money. I paint so it sounds  lot better than giving away my free time to my job with no pay. Thats like adult punishment.,1,

I would find the experience of learning about Norway and Norway's culture enjoyable. In my life I have worked at institutions that have attracted workers from all over the world. I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to meet these people and get to know them. It has been so interesting learning about the lives of these wonderful people. I did work with one person from Norway for a short time. He was so enamored with the United States and loved the US so much that it was hard to get him to talk about Norway.

I would find this experience enjoyable. It would be fun to mix things up with a client from another country, and I would enjoy learning about a new place. Even if it doesn't lead to work travel, it would help me if I ever decided to take a personal trip to Norway.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable. I like to learn about other countries and cultures. I do not know much about Norway.,1,
I would find this experience enjoyable.  It is an interesting project that I wouldn't always get the opportunity to do.  It would also be an important project that would separate me from others when it comes time for promotions or other career opportunities.,1,
I would enjoy this a lot. I love traveling, and travel in the Nordics a lot. I would be perfect for this.,1,

I would find the experience very enjoyable. Learning about new places and cultures is always exciting and having this knowledge could put me ahead of others in my company and give me opportunities that others are not qualified for.

I find it neither. I don't think the experience would be enjoyable. However, because it is traveling, which is eventful, It would not be boring.,1,
I'd love it, I love learning about new cultures no matter where in the world they are.,1,
It would be an interesting experience.  Right now I don't know much about that country and it's always good to learn about other cultures.,1,
